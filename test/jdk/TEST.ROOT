# This file identifies the root of the test-suite hierarchy.
# It also contains test-suite configuration information.

# The list of keywords supported in the entire test suite.  The
# "intermittent" keyword marks tests known to fail intermittently.
# The "randomness" keyword marks tests using randomness with test
# cases differing from run to run. (A test using a fixed random seed
# would not count as "randomness" by this definition.) Extra care
# should be taken to handle test failures of intermittent or
# randomness tests.
#
# A test flagged with cgroups uses cgroups.
#
# Notes on "client" keywords : headful sound printer multimon
# ===========================================================
#
# These keywords are there to help with test selection so that
# tests that need a particular resource can be selected to run on a system
# with that resource. Conversely "!somekeyword" can be used to exclude tests
# on a system without such a resource.
# Caution: If you are always excluding tests using any of these keywords then you
# are likely missing many important tests.
#
# "headful". A "headful" test requires a graphical environment to meaningfully run.
# This does not have to mean a physical host, since a VM can be configured as headful.
# Tests that are not headful are "headless".
# Note: all manual tests are assumed to be headful and do not need the keyword.
#
# "printer". Not all tests of printing APIs require a printer, but many do.
# So a "printer" test requires a printer to be installed to do anything meaningful.
# Tests may not fail if there is none, instead just silently return.
# But they also may legitimately throw an Exception depending on the test.
# Also printer tests are not necessarily headful, but some are, and some are automated.
#
# "sound". Similarly, not all sound tests require audio devices, but many do.
# A test flagged with key "sound" needs audio devices on the system.
# Also they are not necessarily "headful", since they don't require a display etc.
# But sometimes they may be accompanied by the headful keyword, since sound
# is often linked to access to desktop resources and headful systems are
# also more likely to have audio devices (ie meaning both input and output)
#
# "multimon" should be used in conjunction with headful and is used to identify
# tests which require two displays connected.
