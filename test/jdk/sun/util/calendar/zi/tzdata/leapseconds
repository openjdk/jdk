# There were no leap seconds before 1972, because the official mechanism
# accounting for the discrepancy between atomic time and the earth's rotation
# did not exist.

# The correction (+ or -) is made at the given time, so lines
# will typically look like:
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:60	+	R/S
# or
#	Leap	YEAR	MON	DAY	23:59:59	-	R/S

# If the leap second is Rolling (R) the given time is local time (unused here).
