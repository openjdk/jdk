java/math/BigInteger/largeMemory/DivisionOverflow.java          0000000 generic-all
java/math/BigInteger/largeMemory/StringConstructorOverflow.java 0000000 generic-all

jdk/internal/misc/CDS/ArchivedEnumTest.java                     0000000 generic-all

# The test case is incorrect. There's no guarantee that running a JVM with the following
# parameters will always cause the class java/lang/invoke/MethodHandleStatics to be initialized
java/lang/invoke/DumpMethodHandleInternals.java                 0000000 generic-all

# The test uses "--add-modules jdk.internal.le" during production.
# So the test is incompatible with AOT_JDK testing because because all runs must have consistent module options on the command line.
