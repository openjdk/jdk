# The test case is incorrect. There's no guarantee that running a JVM with the following
# parameters will always cause the class java/lang/invoke/MethodHandleStatics to be initialized

# This test checks for a warning message that's already printed by
# sun.util.locale.BaseLocale.<clinit> during the training run. Because BaseLocale is aot-initialized,
# this message will not be printed in the production run.

# Preview project specific failures go here at the end of the file.
#
# These are NOT failures that occur with the '--enable-preview' option
# specified; those go in the appropriate ProblemList-enable-preview.txt file.
# These are failures that occur WITHOUT the '--enable-preview' option
# specified AND occur because of some issue with preview project code,
# in either implementation or test code.
