##### Summary #####
This test is used to check the interop compatibility on JSSE among different
JDK releases. The oldest version supported by the test is JDK 7. Some of Java
source files, JdkUtils.java, Server.java, and Client.java, use only JDK 7-compliant
language features and APIs, in order to allowing different JDK releases can load
and run associated classes.

##### Output #####
The test can generate a report at $JTREG_WORKDIR/scratch/report.html to display
the key information for each case. It also outputs all of details on both of
server and client sides to a separated file at $JTREG_WORKDIR/scratch/test.html.

##### Report Columns #####
No.
    A sequence number. It contains a hyper link to the corresponding details
    in $JTREG_WORKDIR/scratch/test.html.

ServerJDK
    The version of the JDK that acts as server.

ClientJDK
    The version of the JDK that acts as client.

Protocol
    The TLS protocol version.

CipherSuite
    The only enabled cipher suite on both of server and client.

ClientAuth
    If the client authentication is checked, the value is "Y"; otherwise, "N".

SNI
    If the SNI is checked, the value is "Y"; otherwise, "N".

ALPN
    If the ALPN is checked, the value is "Y"; otherwise, "N".

Status
    It indicates the communication status for a test case.
    There are three status:
    SUCCESS: Communication succeed as expected.
    UNEXPECTED_SUCCESS: Communication succeed as unexpected.
    FAIL: Communication fails with unexpected failure.
    EXPECTED_FAIL: Communication fails with expected failure.
    Please note that, if a case finishes as status UNEXPECTED_SUCCESS or FAIL,
    that means the case fails. Any failed case results in the test goes to fail.

##### Usage #####
jtreg [-options] \
    [-Ddebug=<true|false>] \
    [-DfullCases=<true|false>] \
    [-DfullCipherSuites=<true|false>] \
    [-DjdkListFile=</path/to/jdkListFile>] \
    $JDK_WORKSPACE/test/jdk/javax/net/ssl/compatibility/Compatibility.java

Besides the common jtreg options, like -jdk, this test introduces some more
properties:
debug
    It indicates if the test enable -Djavax.net.debug=all. This is a boolean
    property, and the default value is false.
    It is not mandatory.

fullCases
    It indicates if testing the full or mandatory set of parameter values.
    Every parameter provides a mandatory value set that must be covered.
    For more details about the parameter value sets, please see Parameter.java.
    This is a boolean property, and the default value is false.
    It is not mandatory.

fullCipherSuites
    It indicates if testing the full or mandatory set of cipher suites.
    For more details about the specific cipher suite sets, see CipherSuite in
    Parameter.java.
    This is a boolean property, and the default value is false.
    It is not mandatory.

jdkListFile
    It indicate the path of a file, which lists the absolute paths of different
    JDK builds. If no this property, the current testing JDK, specified by JTREG
    option -jdk, is used as the testing JDK.
    It is not mandatory.

##### Usage Examples #####
Example 1
$ jtreg -jdk:/path/to/latest/jdk \
    $JDK_WS/jdk/test/javax/net/ssl/compatibility/Compatibility.java
This example doesn't specify any property introduced by the test. That means
it uses the current testing JDK, namely /path/to/latest/jdk, as server and
client. It doesn't output any debug log, and tests only mandatory parameter
value sets.

Example 2
$ cat /path/to/jdkList
/path/to/jdk7
/path/to/jdk8
/path/to/jdk9
/path/to/jdk10

$ jtreg -jdk:/path/to/latest/jdk \
    -Ddebug=true \
    -DfullCipherSuites=true \
    -DjdkListFile=/path/to/jdkList \
    $JDK_WS/jdk/test/javax/net/ssl/compatibility/Compatibility.java
The above example uses a file "/path/to/jdkList" to contain the paths of local
different JDK builds through 7 to 10. The execution uses each of JDK builds as
server and client respectively. And it enables SSL debug flag, and tests the
full parameter value set.
