Usage: jpackage <options>

Sample usages:
--------------
    Generate an application package suitable for the host system:
        For a modular application:
            jpackage -n name -p modulePath -m moduleName/className
        For a non-modular application:
            jpackage -i inputDir -n name \
                --main-class className --main-jar myJar.jar
        From a pre-built application image:
            jpackage -n name --app-image appImageDir

    Generate an application image:
        For a modular application:
            jpackage --type app-image -n name -p modulePath \
                -m moduleName/className
        For a non-modular application:
            jpackage --type app-image -i inputDir -n name \
                --main-class className --main-jar myJar.jar
        To provide your own options to jlink, run jlink separately:
            jlink --output appRuntimeImage -p modulePath \
                --add-modules moduleName \
                --no-header-files [<additional jlink options>...]
            jpackage --type app-image -n name \
                -m moduleName/className --runtime-image appRuntimeImage

    Generate a Java runtime package:
        jpackage -n name --runtime-image <runtime-image>

    Sign the predefined application image:
        jpackage --type app-image --app-image <app-image> \
            --mac-sign [<additional signing options>...]
        Note: the only additional options that are permitted in this mode are:
              the set of additional mac signing options and --verbose

Options for creating the runtime image:
  --add-modules <module name>[,<module name>...]
          A comma (",") separated list of modules to add
          This module list, along with the main module (if specified)
          will be passed to jlink as the --add-module argument.
          If not specified, either just the main module (if --module is
          specified), or the default set of modules (if --main-jar is
          specified) are used.
          This option can be used multiple times.
  --jlink-options <jlink options>
          A space separated list of options to pass to jlink
          If not specified, defaults to "--strip-native-commands
          --strip-debug --no-man-pages --no-header-files".

          Each path is either a directory of modules or the path to a
          modular jar.

          subdirectory (or any other directory that is valid in the "Contents"
          directory of the application bundle). Otherwise, jpackage may produce
          invalid application bundle which may fail code signing and/or
          notarization.
  --input -i <directory path>
          Path of the input directory that contains the files to be packaged
          (absolute path or relative to the current directory)

          "launcher-as-service", "main-class", "main-jar", and "module"
          can be used.
          These options are added to, or used to overwrite, the original
          command line options to build an additional alternative launcher.
          The main application launcher will be built from the command line
          options. Additional alternative launchers can be built using
          this option, and this option can be used multiple times to
