/**
 * @test
 * @bug 8352088
 * @summary If ThreadGroupReference.groups() is called very early on from an
 *          event handler, it can cause a deadlock because the call can result
 *          in ClassPrepareEvents, which the debug agent will block on until
 *          the debugger handles them, which it won't because the event handler
 *          thread is waiting for a reply to ThreadGroupReference.groups().
 *
 * @run build TestScaffold VMConnection TargetListener TargetAdapter
 * @run compile -g EarlyThreadGroupChildrenTest.java
 * @run main/othervm/timeout=20 EarlyThreadGroupChildrenTest
