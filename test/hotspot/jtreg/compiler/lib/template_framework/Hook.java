 * {@link Hook}s can be {@link #anchor}ed for a certain scope in a Template, and all nested
 * Templates in this scope, and then from within this scope, any Template can
 * {@link #insert} code to where the {@link Hook} was {@link #anchor}ed. This can be useful to reach
 * "back" or to some outer scope, e.g. while generating code for a method, one can reach out
 * to the class scope to insert fields.
 *
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * var myHook = new Hook("MyHook");
 *
 * var template1 = Template.make("name", (String name) -> body(
 *     """
 *     public static int #name = 42;
 *     """
 * ));
 *
 * var template2 = Template.make(() -> body(
 *     """
 *     public class Test {
 *     """,
 *     // Anchor the hook here.
 *     myHook.anchor(
 *         """
 *         public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         System.out.println("$field: " + $field)
 *         """,
 *         // Reach out to where the hook was anchored, and insert the code of template1.
 *         myHook.insert(template1.asToken($("field"))),
 *         """
 *         }
 *         """
