/**
 * A {@link Hook} can be {@link #anchor}ed for a certain scope ({@link ScopeToken}), and that
 * anchoring stays active for any nested scope or nested {@link Template}. With {@link #insert},
 * one can insert a template ({@link TemplateToken}) or scope ({@link ScopeToken}) to where the
 * {@link Hook} was {@link #anchor}'ed. If the hook was anchored for multiple outer scopes, the
 * innermost is chosen for insertion.
 *
 * <p>
 * This can be useful to reach "back" or to some outer scope, e.g. while generating code for a
 * method, one can reach out to the class scope to insert fields. Or one may want to reach back
 * to the beginning of a method to insert local variables that should be live for the whole method.
 *
 * <p>
 * The choice of {@link ScopeToken} is very important and powerful.
 * For example, if you want to insert a {@link DataName} to the scope of an anchor,
 * it is important that the scope of the insertion is transparent for {@link DataName}s,
 * e.g. using {@link Template#transparentScope}. In most cases, we want {@link DataName}s to escape
 * the inserted scope but not the anchor scope, so the anchor scope should be
 * non-transparent for {@link DataName}s, e.g. using {@link Template#scope}.
 * Example:
 *
 * <p>
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * var myHook = new Hook("MyHook");
 *
 * var template = Template.make(() -> scope(
 *     """
 *     public class Test {
 *     """,
 *     // Anchor the hook here.
 *     myHook.anchor(scope(
 *         """
 *         public static void main(String[] args) {
 *         System.out.println("$field: " + $field)
 *         """,
 *         // Reach out to where the hook was anchored, and insert some code.
 *         myHook.insert(transparentScope(
 *             // The field (DataName) escapes because the inserted scope is "transparentScope"
 *             addDataName($("field"), Primitives.INTS, MUTABLE),
 *             """
 *             public static int $field = 42;
 *             """
 *         )),
 *         """
 *         }
 *         """
 *     )),
 *     """
 *     }
 *     """
 * ));
 * }
 *
 * <p>
 * Similarly, it may or may not be desirable for hashtag replacements to escape
 * an insertion scope or an anchoring scope.
 *
 * @param name The name of the Hook, for debugging purposes only.
