## NSK JDB Tests failing with wrapper

####
## The tests expect an NPE to be uncaught, but nsk.share.MainWrapper
## introduces exception handlers.

# Test expects that the "up" command should print "End of stack" because there are
# normally no frames above the test's main method. However, nsk.share.MainWrapper
# introduces more frames above the test's main method, so the test fails.

# This test times out on Windows and Linux. This is due to the test forcing OOME in
# the debuggee, which can lead to I/O poller threads exiting. Because
# of this no vthreads can complete their reads, and the test times out as a result.

# Fails because resume of a virtual thread is not enough to allow the virtual thread

## Tests incompatible with  with virtual test thread factory.
## There is no goal to run all test with virtual test thread factory.
## So any test migth be added as incompatible, the bug is not required.
