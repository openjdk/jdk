## NSK JDB Tests failing with wrapper

# Test expects that the "up" command should print "End of stack" because there are
# normally no frames above the test's main method. However, nsk.share.MainWrapper
# introduces more frames above the test's main method, so the test fails.

# This test times out on Windows and Linux. This is due to the test forcing OOME in
# the debuggee, which can lead to I/O poller threads exiting. Because
# of this no vthreads can complete their reads, and the test times out as a result.

###
# The test first suspends a vthread and all the carriers and then it resumes the vthread expecting it
# to run to completion. In mainline it only works because the suspension step happens while the vthread is
# pinned to the carrier blocked on synchronized. So the carrier only actually suspends on the next unmount
# transition which in this test happens once the vthread has finished executing the expected code.

###
# The test sends a StopThread to a vthread expecting that is currently pinned to the carrier blocked on
# synchronized. Since the vthread is now unmounted StopThread returns JVMTI_ERROR_OPAQUE_FRAME error.
