The tests located under this directory run tests from the Java Concurrency
Stress test suite[1] (a.k.a. jcstress). This suite aims to verify the
correctness of concurrency support in the JDK.

All the tests are run through the test driver class -- JcstressRunner, 
spawns a new JVM to run one jcstress test and checks that it finishes
successfully. Before you start these tests, you should get the specified
build of org.openjdk.jcstress:jcstress-tests-all, the quickest way of
get specified build is download the prebuilt JAR from
[here](https://builds.shipilev.net/jcstress/).
You should specific the JAR location with jtreg option such as
-Djdk.test.lib.artifacts.jcstress-tests-all=jcstress-tests-all-20241217-2035.jar

When the used version of org.openjdk.jcstress:jcstress-tests-all needs to be
changed, one should make corresponding changes to the artifact description in
JcstressRunner and rerun applications.jcstress.TestGenerator.

The */Test.java files should never be modified directly, because they are
generated by TestGenerator and therefore all required changes must be made in
that class.
