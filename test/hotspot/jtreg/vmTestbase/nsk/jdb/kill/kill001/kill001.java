 * @summary converted from VM Testbase nsk/jdb/kill/kill001.
 * VM Testbase keywords: [jpda, jdb]
 * VM Testbase readme:
 * DECSRIPTION
 * A positive test case for the 'kill <thread id> <expr>' command.
 * The debuggee program (kill001a.java) creates a number of additional
 * threads with name like "MyThread-<number>" and starts them. The jdb
 * suspends debuggee at moment when additional threads try to obtain
 * lock on synchronized object (previously locked in main thread)
 * and then tries to kill them. If these threads are killed then
 * the value of the special "killed" variable should be set
 * to the number of additional threads created. The value of
 * the "killed" variable is checked by "eval <expr>" command.
 * The test passes if the value is equal to the number of
 * additional threads created and fails otherwise.
 * COMMENTS
 *  Modified due to fix of the test bug:
 *  4940902 TEST_BUG: race in nsk/jdb/kill/kill001
 *  Modified due to fix of the bug:
 *  5024081 TEST_BUG: nsk/jdb/kill/kill001 is slow
