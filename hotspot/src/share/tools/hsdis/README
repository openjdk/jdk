'hsdis':  A HotSpot plugin for disassembling dynamically generated code.

The files in this directory (Makefile, hsdis.[ch], hsdis-demo.c)
are built independently of the HotSpot JVM.

To use the plugin with a JVM, you need a new version that can load it.
If the product mode of your JVM does not accept -XX:+PrintAssembly,
you do not have a version that is new enough.

* Building

To build this project you a copy of GNU binutils to build against.  It
is known to work with binutils 2.17 and binutils 2.19.1.  Download a
copy of the software from http://directory.fsf.org/project/binutils or
one of it's mirrors.  Builds targetting windows should use at least
2.19 and currently requires the use of a cross compiler.

The makefile looks for the sources in build/binutils or you can
specify it's location to the makefile using BINTUILS=path.  It will
configure binutils and build it first and then build and link the
disasembly adapter.  Make all will build the default target for your
platform.  If you platform support both 32 and 64 simultaneously then
"make both" will build them both at once.  "make all64" will
explicitly build the 64 bit version.  By default this will build the
disassembler library only.  If you build demo it will build a demo
program that attempts to exercise the library.

Windows

In theory this should be buildable on Windows but getting a working
GNU build environment on Windows has proven difficult.  MINGW should
be able to do it but at the time of this writing I was unable to get
this working.  Instead you can use the mingw cross compiler on linux
to produce the windows binaries.  For 32-bit windows you can install
mingw32 using your package manager and it will be added to your path
automatically.  For 64-bit you need to download the 64 bit mingw from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64.  Grab a copy of the
complete toolchain and unpack it somewhere.  Put the bin directory of
the toolchain in your path.  The mingw installs contain cross compile
versions of gcc that are named with a prefix to indicate what they are
targetting and you must tell the Makefile which one to use.  This
should either be i586-mingw32msvc or x86_64-pc-mingw32 depending on
which on you are targetting and there should be a version of gcc in
your path named i586-mingw32msvc-gcc or x86_64-pc-mingw32-gcc.  Tell
the makefile what prefix to use to find the mingw tools by using
MINGW=.  For example:

make MINGW=i586-mingw32msvc BINTUILS=build/binutils-2.19.1

will build the Win32 cross compiled version of hsdis based on 2.19.1.

* Installing

Products are named like build/$OS-$LIBARCH/hsdis-$LIBARCH.so.  You can
install them on your LD_LIBRARY_PATH, or inside of your JRE next to
$LIBARCH/libjvm.so.

Now test:

  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH .../hsdis/build/$OS-$LIBARCH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
  dargs='-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintAssembly'
  dargs=$dargs' -XX:PrintAssemblyOptions=hsdis-print-bytes'
  java $dargs -Xbatch CompileCommand=print,*String.hashCode HelloWorld

If the product mode of the JVM does not accept -XX:+PrintAssembly,
you do not have a version new enough to use the hsdis plugin.
