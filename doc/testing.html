<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>The bulk of JDK tests use <a
href="https://openjdk.org/jtreg/">jtreg</a>, a regression test framework
and test runner built for the JDK's specific needs. Other test
frameworks are also used. The different test frameworks can be executed
directly, but there is also a set of make targets intended to simplify
the interface, and figure out how to run your tests for you.</p>
<h2 id="running-tests-locally-with-make-test">Running tests locally with
<code>make test</code></h2>
<p>This is the easiest way to get started. Assuming you've built the JDK
locally, execute:</p>
<pre><code>$ make test</code></pre>
<p>This will run a default set of tests against the JDK, and present you
with the results. <code>make test</code> is part of a family of
test-related make targets which simplify running tests, because they
invoke the various test frameworks for you. The "make test framework" is
simple to start with, but more complex ad-hoc combination of tests is
also possible. You can always invoke the test frameworks directly if you
want even more control.</p>
<p>Some example command-lines:</p>
<pre><code>$ make test-tier1
$ make test-jdk_lang JTREG=&quot;JOBS=8&quot;
$ make test TEST=jdk_lang
$ make test-only TEST=&quot;gtest:LogTagSet gtest:LogTagSetDescriptions&quot; GTEST=&quot;REPEAT=-1&quot;
$ make test TEST=&quot;hotspot:hotspot_gc&quot; JTREG=&quot;JOBS=1;TIMEOUT_FACTOR=8;JAVA_OPTIONS=-XshowSettings -Xlog:gc+ref=debug&quot;
$ make test TEST=&quot;jtreg:test/hotspot:hotspot_gc test/hotspot/jtreg/native_sanity/JniVersion.java&quot;
$ make test TEST=&quot;micro:java.lang.reflect&quot; MICRO=&quot;FORK=1;WARMUP_ITER=2&quot;
$ make exploded-test TEST=tier2</code></pre>
<p>"tier1" and "tier2" refer to tiered testing, see further down. "TEST"
is a test selection argument which the make test framework will use to
try to find the tests you want. It iterates over the available test
frameworks, and if the test isn't present in one, it tries the next one.
The main target <code>test</code> uses the jdk-image as the tested
product. There is also an alternate target <code>exploded-test</code>
that uses the exploded image instead. Not all tests will run
successfully on the exploded image, but using this target can greatly
improve rebuild times for certain workflows.</p>
<p>Previously, <code>make test</code> was used to invoke an old system
for running tests, and <code>make run-test</code> was used for the new
test framework. For backward compatibility with scripts and muscle
memory, <code>run-test</code> and variants like
<code>exploded-run-test</code> or <code>run-test-tier1</code> are kept
as aliases.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration</h3>
<p>To be able to run JTReg tests, <code>configure</code> needs to know
where to find the JTReg test framework. If it is not picked up
automatically by configure, use the
<code>--with-jtreg=&lt;path to jtreg home&gt;</code> option to point to
the JTReg framework. Note that this option should point to the JTReg
home, i.e. the top directory, containing <code>lib/jtreg.jar</code> etc.
(An alternative is to set the <code>JT_HOME</code> environment variable
to point to the JTReg home before running <code>configure</code>.)</p>
<p>To be able to run microbenchmarks, <code>configure</code> needs to
know where to find the JMH dependency. Use
<code>--with-jmh=&lt;path to JMH jars&gt;</code> to point to a directory
containing the core JMH and transitive dependencies. The recommended
dependencies can be retrieved by running
<code>sh make/devkit/createJMHBundle.sh</code>, after which
<code>--with-jmh=build/jmh/jars</code> should work.</p>
<p>When tests fail or timeout, jtreg runs its failure handler to capture
necessary data from the system where the test was run. This data can
then be used to analyze the test failures. Collecting this data involves
running various commands (which are listed in files residing in
<code>test/failure_handler/src/share/conf</code>) and some of these
commands use <code>sudo</code>. If the system's <code>sudoers</code>
file isn't configured to allow running these commands, then it can
result in password being prompted during the failure handler execution.
Typically, when running locally, collecting this additional data isn't
always necessary. To disable running the failure handler, use
<code>--enable-jtreg-failure-handler=no</code> when running
<code>configure</code>. If, however, you want to let the failure handler
to run and don't want to be prompted for sudo password, then you can
configure your <code>sudoers</code> file appropriately. Please read the
necessary documentation of your operating system to see how to do that;
here we only show one possible way of doing that - edit the
<code>/etc/sudoers.d/sudoers</code> file to include the following
line:</p>
<pre><code>johndoe ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /sbin/dmesg</code></pre>
<p>This line configures <code>sudo</code> to <em>not</em> prompt for
password for the <code>/sbin/dmesg</code> command (this is one of the
commands that is listed in the files at
<code>test/failure_handler/src/share/conf</code>), for the user
<code>johndoe</code>. Here <code>johndoe</code> is the user account
under which the jtreg tests are run. Replace the username with a
relevant user account of your system.</p>
<h2 id="test-selection">Test selection</h2>
<p>All functionality is available using the <code>test</code> make
target. In this use case, the test or tests to be executed is controlled
using the <code>TEST</code> variable. To speed up subsequent test runs
with no source code changes, <code>test-only</code> can be used instead,
which do not depend on the source and test image build.</p>
<p>For some common top-level tests, direct make targets have been
generated. This includes all JTReg test groups, the hotspot gtest, and
custom tests (if present). This means that <code>make test-tier1</code>
is equivalent to <code>make test TEST="tier1"</code>, but the latter is
more tab-completion friendly. For more complex test runs, the
<code>test TEST="x"</code> solution needs to be used.</p>
<p>The test specifications given in <code>TEST</code> is parsed into
fully qualified test descriptors, which clearly and unambiguously show
which tests will be run. As an example, <code>:tier1</code> will expand
to include all subcomponent test directories that define
<code>tier1</code>, for example:
<code>jtreg:$(TOPDIR)/test/hotspot/jtreg:tier1 jtreg:$(TOPDIR)/test/jdk:tier1 jtreg:$(TOPDIR)/test/langtools:tier1 ...</code>.
You can always submit a list of fully qualified test descriptors in the
<code>TEST</code> variable if you want to shortcut the parser.</p>
<h3 id="common-test-groups">Common Test Groups</h3>
<p>Ideally, all tests are run for every change but this may not be
practical due to the limited testing resources, the scope of the change,
etc.</p>
<p>The source tree currently defines a few common test groups in the
relevant <code>TEST.groups</code> files. There are test groups that
cover a specific component, for example <code>hotspot_gc</code>. It is a
good idea to look into <code>TEST.groups</code> files to get a sense
what tests are relevant to a particular JDK component.</p>
<p>Component-specific tests may miss some unintended consequences of a
change, so other tests should also be run. Again, it might be
impractical to run all tests, and therefore <em>tiered</em> test groups
exist. Tiered test groups are not component-specific, but rather cover
the significant parts of the entire JDK.</p>
<p>Multiple tiers allow balancing test coverage and testing costs. Lower
test tiers are supposed to contain the simpler, quicker and more stable
tests. Higher tiers are supposed to contain progressively more thorough,
slower, and sometimes less stable tests, or the tests that require
special configuration.</p>
<p>Contributors are expected to run the tests for the areas that are
changed, and the first N tiers they can afford to run, but at least
tier1.</p>
<p>A brief description of the tiered test groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>tier1</code>: This is the most fundamental test tier.
Roughly speaking, a failure of a test in this tier has the potential to
indicate a problem that would affect many Java programs. Tests in
<code>tier1</code> include tests of HotSpot, core APIs in the
<code>java.base</code> module, and the <code>javac</code> compiler.
Multiple developers run these tests every day. Because of the widespread
use, the tests in <code>tier1</code> are carefully selected and
optimized to run fast, and to run in the most stable manner. As a
guideline, nearly all individual tests in <code>tier1</code> are
expected to run to completion in ten seconds or less when run on common
configurations used for development. Long-running tests, even of core
functionality, should occur in higher tiers or be covered in other kinds
of testing. The test failures in <code>tier1</code> are usually followed
up on quickly, either with fixes, or adding relevant tests to problem
list. GitHub Actions workflows, if enabled, run <code>tier1</code>
tests.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tier2</code>: This test group covers even more ground.
These contain, among other things, tests that either run for too long to
be at <code>tier1</code>, or may require special configuration, or tests
that are less stable, or cover the broader range of non-core JVM and JDK
features/components (for example, XML).</p></li>
<li><p><code>tier3</code>: This test group includes more stressful
tests, the tests for corner cases not covered by previous tiers, plus
the tests that require GUIs. As such, this suite should either be run
with low concurrency (<code>TEST_JOBS=1</code>), or without headful
tests(<code>JTREG_KEYWORDS=\!headful</code>), or both.</p></li>
<li><p><code>tier4</code>: This test group includes every other test not
covered by previous tiers. It includes, for example,
<code>vmTestbase</code> suites for Hotspot, which run for many hours
even on large machines. It also runs GUI tests, so the same
<code>TEST_JOBS</code> and <code>JTREG_KEYWORDS</code> caveats
apply.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jtreg">JTReg</h3>
<p>JTReg tests can be selected either by picking a JTReg test group, or
a selection of files or directories containing JTReg tests.
Documentation can be found at <a
href="https://openjdk.org/jtreg/">https://openjdk.org/jtreg/</a>, note
especially the extensive <a
href="https://openjdk.org/jtreg/faq.html">FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>JTReg test groups can be specified either without a test root, e.g.
<code>:tier1</code> (or <code>tier1</code>, the initial colon is
optional), or with, e.g. <code>hotspot:tier1</code>,
<code>test/jdk:jdk_util</code> or
<code>$(TOPDIR)/test/hotspot/jtreg:hotspot_all</code>. The test root can
be specified either as an absolute path, or a path relative to the JDK
top directory, or the <code>test</code> directory. For simplicity, the
hotspot JTReg test root, which really is <code>hotspot/jtreg</code> can
be abbreviated as just <code>hotspot</code>.</p>
<p>When specified without a test root, all matching groups from all test
roots will be added. Otherwise, only the group from the specified test
root will be added.</p>
<p>Individual JTReg tests or directories containing JTReg tests can also
be specified, like
<code>test/hotspot/jtreg/native_sanity/JniVersion.java</code> or
<code>hotspot/jtreg/native_sanity</code>. Just like for test root
selection, you can either specify an absolute path (which can even point
to JTReg tests outside the source tree), or a path relative to either
the JDK top directory or the <code>test</code> directory.
<code>hotspot</code> can be used as an alias for
<code>hotspot/jtreg</code> here as well.</p>
<p>As long as the test groups or test paths can be uniquely resolved,
you do not need to enter the <code>jtreg:</code> prefix. If this is not
possible, or if you want to use a fully qualified test descriptor, add
<code>jtreg:</code>, e.g.
<code>jtreg:test/hotspot/jtreg/native_sanity</code>.</p>
<h3 id="gtest">Gtest</h3>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To be able to run the Gtest suite, you need to
configure your build to be able to find a proper version of the gtest
source. For details, see the section <a
href="building.html#running-tests">"Running Tests" in the build
documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Since the Hotspot Gtest suite is so quick, the default is to run all
tests. This is specified by just <code>gtest</code>, or as a fully
qualified test descriptor <code>gtest:all</code>.</p>
<p>If you want, you can single out an individual test or a group of
tests, for instance <code>gtest:LogDecorations</code> or
<code>gtest:LogDecorations.level_test_vm</code>. This can be
particularly useful if you want to run a shaky test repeatedly.</p>
<p>For Gtest, there is a separate test suite for each JVM variant. The
JVM variant is defined by adding <code>/&lt;variant&gt;</code> to the
test descriptor, e.g. <code>gtest:Log/client</code>. If you specify no
variant, gtest will run once for each JVM variant present (e.g. server,
client). So if you only have the server JVM present, then
<code>gtest:all</code> will be equivalent to
<code>gtest:all/server</code>.</p>
<h3 id="microbenchmarks">Microbenchmarks</h3>
<p>Which microbenchmarks to run is selected using a regular expression
following the <code>micro:</code> test descriptor, e.g.,
<code>micro:java.lang.reflect</code>. This delegates the test selection
to JMH, meaning package name, class name and even benchmark method names
can be used to select tests.</p>
<p>Using special characters like <code>|</code> in the regular
expression is possible, but needs to be escaped multiple times:
<code>micro:ArrayCopy\\\\\|reflect</code>.</p>
<h3 id="special-tests">Special tests</h3>
<p>A handful of odd tests that are not covered by any other testing
framework are accessible using the <code>special:</code> test
descriptor. Currently, this includes <code>failure-handler</code> and
<code>make</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Failure handler testing is run using
<code>special:failure-handler</code> or just
<code>failure-handler</code> as test descriptor.</p></li>
<li><p>Tests for the build system, including both makefiles and related
functionality, is run using <code>special:make</code> or just
<code>make</code> as test descriptor. This is equivalent to
<code>special:make:all</code>.</p>
<p>A specific make test can be run by supplying it as argument, e.g.
<code>special:make:idea</code>. As a special syntax, this can also be
expressed as <code>make-idea</code>, which allows for command lines as
<code>make test-make-idea</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="test-results-and-summary">Test results and summary</h2>
<p>At the end of the test run, a summary of all tests run will be
presented. This will have a consistent look, regardless of what test
suites were used. This is a sample summary:</p>
<pre><code>==============================
Test summary
==============================
   TEST                                          TOTAL  PASS  FAIL ERROR
&gt;&gt; jtreg:jdk/test:tier1                           1867  1865     2     0 &lt;&lt;
   jtreg:langtools/test:tier1                     4711  4711     0     0
   jtreg:nashorn/test:tier1                        133   133     0     0
==============================
TEST FAILURE</code></pre>
<p>Tests where the number of TOTAL tests does not equal the number of
PASSed tests will be considered a test failure. These are marked with
the <code>&gt;&gt; ... &lt;&lt;</code> marker for easy
identification.</p>
<p>The classification of non-passed tests differs a bit between test
suites. In the summary, ERROR is used as a catch-all for tests that
neither passed nor are classified as failed by the framework. This might
indicate test framework error, timeout or other problems.</p>
<p>In case of test failures, <code>make test</code> will exit with a
non-zero exit value.</p>
<p>All tests have their result stored in
<code>build/$BUILD/test-results/$TEST_ID</code>, where TEST_ID is a
path-safe conversion from the fully qualified test descriptor, e.g. for
<code>jtreg:jdk/test:tier1</code> the TEST_ID is
<code>jtreg_jdk_test_tier1</code>. This path is also printed in the log
at the end of the test run.</p>
<p>Additional work data is stored in
<code>build/$BUILD/test-support/$TEST_ID</code>. For some frameworks,
this directory might contain information that is useful in determining
the cause of a failed test.</p>
<h2 id="test-suite-control">Test suite control</h2>
<p>It is possible to control various aspects of the test suites using
make control variables.</p>
<p>These variables use a keyword=value approach to allow multiple values
to be set. So, for instance,
<code>JTREG="JOBS=1;TIMEOUT_FACTOR=8"</code> will set the JTReg
concurrency level to 1 and the timeout factor to 8. This is equivalent
to setting <code>JTREG_JOBS=1 JTREG_TIMEOUT_FACTOR=8</code>, but using
the keyword format means that the <code>JTREG</code> variable is parsed
and verified for correctness, so <code>JTREG="TMIEOUT_FACTOR=8"</code>
would give an error, while <code>JTREG_TMIEOUT_FACTOR=8</code> would
just pass unnoticed.</p>
<p>To separate multiple keyword=value pairs, use <code>;</code>
(semicolon). Since the shell normally eats <code>;</code>, the
recommended usage is to write the assignment inside quotes, e.g.
<code>JTREG="...;..."</code>. This will also make sure spaces are
preserved, as in
<code>JTREG="JAVA_OPTIONS=-XshowSettings -Xlog:gc+ref=debug"</code>.</p>
<p>(Other ways are possible, e.g. using backslash:
<code>JTREG=JOBS=1\;TIMEOUT_FACTOR=8</code>. Also, as a special
technique, the string <code>%20</code> will be replaced with space for
certain options, e.g.
<code>JTREG=JAVA_OPTIONS=-XshowSettings%20-Xlog:gc+ref=debug</code>.
This can be useful if you have layers of scripts and have trouble
getting proper quoting of command line arguments through.)</p>
<p>As far as possible, the names of the keywords have been standardized
between test suites.</p>
<h3 id="general-keywords-test_opts">General keywords (TEST_OPTS)</h3>
<p>Some keywords are valid across different test suites. If you want to
run tests from multiple test suites, or just don't want to care which
test suite specific control variable to use, then you can use the
general TEST_OPTS control variable.</p>
<p>There are also some keywords that applies globally to the test runner
system, not to any specific test suites. These are also available as
TEST_OPTS keywords.</p>
<h4 id="jobs">JOBS</h4>
<p>Currently only applies to JTReg.</p>
<h4 id="timeout_factor">TIMEOUT_FACTOR</h4>
<p>Currently only applies to JTReg.</p>
<h4 id="java_options">JAVA_OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Applies to JTReg, GTest and Micro.</p>
<h4 id="vm_options">VM_OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Applies to JTReg, GTest and Micro.</p>
<h4 id="jcov">JCOV</h4>
<p>This keyword applies globally to the test runner system. If set to
<code>true</code>, it enables JCov coverage reporting for all tests run.
To be useful, the JDK under test must be run with a JDK built with JCov
instrumentation
(<code>configure --with-jcov=&lt;path to directory containing lib/jcov.jar&gt;</code>,
<code>make jcov-image</code>).</p>
<p>The simplest way to run tests with JCov coverage report is to use the
special target <code>jcov-test</code> instead of <code>test</code>, e.g.
<code>make jcov-test TEST=jdk_lang</code>. This will make sure the JCov
image is built, and that JCov reporting is enabled.</p>
<p>The JCov report is stored in
<code>build/$BUILD/test-results/jcov-output/report</code>.</p>
<p>Please note that running with JCov reporting can be very memory
intensive.</p>
<h4 id="jcov_diff_changeset">JCOV_DIFF_CHANGESET</h4>
<p>While collecting code coverage with JCov, it is also possible to find
coverage for only recently changed code. JCOV_DIFF_CHANGESET specifies a
source revision. A textual report will be generated showing coverage of
the diff between the specified revision and the repository tip.</p>
<p>The report is stored in
<code>build/$BUILD/test-results/jcov-output/diff_coverage_report</code>
file.</p>
<h3 id="jtreg-keywords">JTReg keywords</h3>
<h4 id="jobs-1">JOBS</h4>
<p>The test concurrency (<code>-concurrency</code>).</p>
<p>Defaults to TEST_JOBS (if set by <code>--with-test-jobs=</code>),
otherwise it defaults to JOBS, except for Hotspot, where the default is
<em>number of CPU cores/2</em>, but never more than <em>memory size in
GB/2</em>.</p>
<h4 id="timeout_factor-1">TIMEOUT_FACTOR</h4>
<p>The timeout factor (<code>-timeoutFactor</code>).</p>
<p>Defaults to 4.</p>
<h4 id="failure_handler_timeout">FAILURE_HANDLER_TIMEOUT</h4>
<p>Sets the argument <code>-timeoutHandlerTimeout</code> for JTReg. The
default value is 0. This is only valid if the failure handler is
built.</p>
<h4 id="jtreg_test_thread_factory">JTREG_TEST_THREAD_FACTORY</h4>
<p>Sets the <code>-testThreadFactory</code> for JTReg. It should be the
fully qualified classname of a class which implements
<code>java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory</code>. One such implementation
class, named Virtual, is currently part of the JDK build in the
<code>test/jtreg_test_thread_factory/</code> directory. This class gets
compiled during the test image build. The implementation of the Virtual
class creates a new virtual thread for executing each test class.</p>
<h4 id="test_mode">TEST_MODE</h4>
<p>The test mode (<code>agentvm</code> or <code>othervm</code>).</p>
<p>Defaults to <code>agentvm</code>.</p>
<h4 id="assert">ASSERT</h4>
<p>Enable asserts (<code>-ea -esa</code>, or none).</p>
<p>Set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If true, adds
<code>-ea -esa</code>. Defaults to true, except for hotspot.</p>
<h4 id="verbose">VERBOSE</h4>
<p>The verbosity level (<code>-verbose</code>).</p>
<p>Defaults to <code>fail,error,summary</code>.</p>
<h4 id="retain">RETAIN</h4>
<p>What test data to retain (<code>-retain</code>).</p>
<p>Defaults to <code>fail,error</code>.</p>
<h4 id="max_mem">MAX_MEM</h4>
<p>Limit memory consumption (<code>-Xmx</code> and
<code>-vmoption:-Xmx</code>, or none).</p>
<p>Limit memory consumption for JTReg test framework and VM under test.
Set to 0 to disable the limits.</p>
<p>Defaults to 512m, except for hotspot, where it defaults to 0 (no
limit).</p>
<h4 id="max_output">MAX_OUTPUT</h4>
<p>Set the property <code>javatest.maxOutputSize</code> for the
launcher, to change the default JTReg log limit.</p>
<h4 id="keywords">KEYWORDS</h4>
<p>JTReg keywords sent to JTReg using <code>-k</code>. Please be careful
in making sure that spaces and special characters (like <code>!</code>)
are properly quoted. To avoid some issues, the special value
<code>%20</code> can be used instead of space.</p>
<h4 id="extra_problem_lists">EXTRA_PROBLEM_LISTS</h4>
<p>Use additional problem lists file or files, in addition to the
default ProblemList.txt located at the JTReg test roots.</p>
<p>If multiple file names are specified, they should be separated by
space (or, to help avoid quoting issues, the special value
<code>%20</code>).</p>
<p>The file names should be either absolute, or relative to the JTReg
test root of the tests to be run.</p>
<h4 id="run_problem_lists">RUN_PROBLEM_LISTS</h4>
<p>Use the problem lists to select tests instead of excluding them.</p>
<p>Set to <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. If <code>true</code>,
JTReg will use <code>-match:</code> option, otherwise
<code>-exclude:</code> will be used. Default is <code>false</code>.</p>
<h4 id="options">OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Additional options to the JTReg test framework.</p>
<p>Use <code>JTREG="OPTIONS=--help all"</code> to see all available
JTReg options.</p>
<h4 id="java_options-1">JAVA_OPTIONS</h4>
<p>Additional Java options for running test classes (sent to JTReg as
<code>-javaoption</code>).</p>
<h4 id="vm_options-1">VM_OPTIONS</h4>

<h2 id="notes-for-specific-tests">Notes for Specific Tests</h2>
<h3 id="docker-tests">Docker Tests</h3>
<p>Docker tests with default parameters may fail on systems with glibc
versions not compatible with the one used in the default docker image
(e.g., Oracle Linux 7.6 for x86). For example, they pass on Ubuntu 16.04
but fail on Ubuntu 18.04 if run like this on x86:</p>
<pre><code>$ make test TEST=&quot;jtreg:test/hotspot/jtreg/containers/docker&quot;</code></pre>
<p>To run these tests correctly, additional parameters for the correct
docker image are required on Ubuntu 18.04 by using
<code>JAVA_OPTIONS</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ make test TEST=&quot;jtreg:test/hotspot/jtreg/containers/docker&quot; \
    JTREG=&quot;JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djdk.test.docker.image.name=ubuntu
    -Djdk.test.docker.image.version=latest&quot;</code></pre>
<h3 id="non-us-locale">Non-US locale</h3>
<p>If your locale is non-US, some tests are likely to fail. To work
around this you can set the locale to US. On Unix platforms simply
setting <code>LANG="en_US"</code> in the environment before running
tests should work. On Windows or macOS, setting
<code>JTREG="VM_OPTIONS=-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US"</code>
helps for most, but not all test cases.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ export LANG=&quot;en_US&quot; &amp;&amp; make test TEST=...
$ make test JTREG=&quot;VM_OPTIONS=-Duser.language=en -Duser.country=US&quot; TEST=...</code></pre>
<h3 id="pkcs11-tests">PKCS11 Tests</h3>
<p>It is highly recommended to use the latest NSS version when running
PKCS11 tests. Improper NSS version may lead to unexpected failures which
are hard to diagnose. For example,
sun/security/pkcs11/Secmod/AddTrustedCert.java may fail on Ubuntu 18.04
with the default NSS version in the system. To run these tests
correctly, the system property
<code>jdk.test.lib.artifacts.&lt;NAME&gt;</code> is required on Ubuntu
18.04 to specify the alternative NSS lib directory. The
<code>&lt;NAME&gt;</code> component should be replaced with the name
element of the appropriate <code>@Artifact</code> class. (See
<code>test/jdk/sun/security/pkcs11/PKCS11Test.java</code>)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>$ make test TEST=&quot;jtreg:sun/security/pkcs11/Secmod/AddTrustedCert.java&quot; \
    JTREG=&quot;JAVA_OPTIONS=-Djdk.test.lib.artifacts.nsslib-linux_aarch64=/path/to/NSS-libs&quot;</code></pre>
<p>For more notes about the PKCS11 tests, please refer to
test/jdk/sun/security/pkcs11/README.</p>
<h3 id="client-ui-tests">Client UI Tests</h3>
<h4 id="system-key-shortcuts">System key shortcuts</h4>
<p>Some Client UI tests use key sequences which may be reserved by the
operating system. Usually that causes the test failure. So it is highly
recommended to disable system key shortcuts prior testing. The steps to
access and disable system key shortcuts for various platforms are
provided below.</p>
<h5 id="macos">macOS</h5>
<p>Choose Apple menu; System Preferences, click Keyboard, then click
Shortcuts; select or deselect desired shortcut.</p>
<p>For example,
test/jdk/javax/swing/TooltipManager/JMenuItemToolTipKeyBindingsTest/JMenuItemToolTipKeyBindingsTest.java
fails on macOS because it uses <code>CTRL + F1</code> key sequence to
show or hide tooltip message but the key combination is reserved by the
operating system. To run the test correctly the default global key
shortcut should be disabled using the steps described above, and then
deselect "Turn keyboard access on or off" option which is responsible
for <code>CTRL + F1</code> combination.</p>
<h5 id="linux">Linux</h5>
<p>Open the Activities overview and start typing Settings; Choose
Settings, click Devices, then click Keyboard; set or override desired
shortcut.</p>
<h5 id="windows">Windows</h5>
<p>Type <code>gpedit</code> in the Search and then click Edit group
policy; navigate to User Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates
-&gt; Windows Components -&gt; File Explorer; in the right-side pane
look for "Turn off Windows key hotkeys" and double click on it; enable
or disable hotkeys.</p>
<p>Note: restart is required to make the settings take effect.</p>
<h4 id="robot-api">Robot API</h4>
<p>Most automated Client UI tests use <code>Robot</code> API to control
the UI. Usually, the default operating system settings need to be
adjusted for Robot to work correctly. The detailed steps how to access
and update these settings for different platforms are provided
below.</p>
<h5 id="macos-1">macOS</h5>
<p><code>Robot</code> is not permitted to control your Mac by default
since macOS 10.15. To allow it, choose Apple menu -&gt; System Settings,
click Privacy &amp; Security; then click Accessibility and ensure the
following apps are allowed to control your computer: <em>Java</em> and
<em>Terminal</em>. If the tests are run from an IDE, the IDE should be
granted this permission too.</p>
<h5 id="windows-1">Windows</h5>
<p>On Windows if Cygwin terminal is used to run the tests, there is a
delay in focus transfer. Usually it causes automated UI test failure. To
disable the delay, type <code>regedit</code> in the Search and then
select Registry Editor; navigate to the following key:
<code>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Desktop</code>; make sure the
<code>ForegroundLockTimeout</code> value is set to 0.</p>
