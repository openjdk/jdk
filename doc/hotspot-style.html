<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This is a collection of rules, guidelines, and suggestions for
writing HotSpot code. Following these will help new code fit in with
existing HotSpot code, making it easier to read and maintain. Failure to
follow these guidelines may lead to discussion during code reviews, if
not outright rejection of a change.</p>
<h3 id="changing-this-document">Changing this Document</h3>
<p>Proposed changes should be discussed on the <a
href="mailto:hotspot-dev@openjdk.org">HotSpot Developers</a> mailing
list. Changes are likely to be cautious and incremental, since HotSpot
coders have been using these guidelines for years.</p>
<p>Substantive changes are approved by <a
href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7282.html">rough consensus</a>
of the <a href="https://openjdk.org/census#hotspot">HotSpot Group</a>
Members. The Group Lead determines whether consensus has been
reached.</p>
<p>Editorial changes (changes that only affect the description of
HotSpot style, not its substance) do not require the full consensus
gathering process. The normal HotSpot pull request process may be used
for editorial changes, with the additional requirement that the
requisite reviewers are also HotSpot Group Members.</p>
<h3 id="why-care-about-style">Why Care About Style?</h3>
<p>Some programmers seem to have lexers and even C preprocessors
installed directly behind their eyeballs. The rest of us require code
that is not only functionally correct but also easy to read. More than
that, since there is no one style for easy-to-read code, and since a
mashup of many styles is just as confusing as no style at all, it is
important for coders to be conscious of the many implicit stylistic
choices that historically have gone into the HotSpot code base.</p>
<p>Some of these guidelines are driven by the cross-platform
requirements for HotSpot. Shared code must work on a variety of
platforms, and may encounter deficiencies in some. Using platform
conditionalization in shared code is usually avoided, while shared code
is strongly preferred to multiple platform-dependent implementations, so
some language features may be recommended against.</p>
<p>Some of the guidelines here are relatively arbitrary choices among
equally plausible alternatives. The purpose of stating and enforcing
these rules is largely to provide a consistent look to the code. That
consistency makes the code more readable by avoiding non-functional
distractions from the interesting functionality.</p>
<p>When changing pre-existing code, it is reasonable to adjust it to
match these conventions. Exception: If the pre-existing code clearly
conforms locally to its own peculiar conventions, it is not worth
reformatting the whole thing. Also consider separating changes that make
extensive stylistic updates from those which make functional
changes.</p>
<h3 id="counterexamples">Counterexamples</h3>
<p>Many of the guidelines mentioned here have (sometimes widespread)
counterexamples in the HotSpot code base. Finding a counterexample is
not sufficient justification for new code to follow the counterexample
as a precedent, since readers of your code will rightfully expect your
code to follow the greater bulk of precedents documented here.</p>
<p>Occasionally a guideline mentioned here may be just out of synch with
the actual HotSpot code base. If you find that a guideline is
consistently contradicted by a large number of counterexamples, please
bring it up for discussion and possible change. The architectural rule,
of course, is "When in Rome do as the Romans". Sometimes in the suburbs
of Rome the rules are a little different; these differences can be
pointed out here.</p>
<h2 id="structure-and-formatting">Structure and Formatting</h2>
<h3 id="factoring-and-class-design">Factoring and Class Design</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Group related code together, so readers can concentrate on one
section of one file.</p></li>
<li><p>Classes are the primary code structuring mechanism. Place related
functionality in a class, or a set of related classes. Use of either
namespaces or public non-member functions is rare in HotSpot code.
Static non-member functions are not uncommon.</p></li>
<li><p>If a class <code>FooBar</code> is going to be used in more than
one place, put it a file named fooBar.hpp and fooBar.cpp. If the class
is a sidekick to a more important class <code>BazBat</code>, it can go
in bazBat.hpp.</p></li>
<li><p>Put a member function <code>FooBar::bang</code> into the same
file that defined <code>FooBar</code>, or its associated <em>.inline.hpp
or </em>.cpp file.</p></li>
<li><p>Use public accessor functions for member variables accessed
outside the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Assign names to constant literals and use the names
instead.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep functions small, a screenful at most. Split out chunks of
logic into file-local classes or static functions if needed.</p></li>
<li><p>Factor away nonessential complexity into local inline helper
functions and helper classes.</p></li>
<li><p>Think clearly about internal invariants that apply to each class,
and document them in the form of asserts within member
functions.</p></li>
<li><p>Make simple, self-evident contracts for member functions. If you
cannot communicate a simple contract, redesign the class.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement classes as if expecting rough usage by clients. Check
for incorrect usage of a class using <code>assert(...)</code>,
<code>guarantee(...)</code>, <code>ShouldNotReachHere()</code> and
comments wherever needed. Performance is almost never a reason to omit
asserts.</p></li>
<li><p>When possible, design as if for reusability. This forces a clear
design of the class's externals, and clean hiding of its
internals.</p></li>
<li><p>Initialize all variables and data structures to a known state. If
a class has a constructor, initialize it there.</p></li>
<li><p>Do no optimization before its time. Prove the need to
optimize.</p></li>
<li><p>When you must defactor to optimize, preserve as much structure as
possible. If you must hand-inline some name, label the local copy with
the original name.</p></li>
<li><p>If you need to use a hidden detail (e.g., a structure offset),
name it (as a constant or function) in the class that owns it.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't use the Copy and Paste keys to replicate more than a couple
lines of code. Name what you must repeat.</p></li>
<li><p>If a class needs a member function to change a user-visible
attribute, the change should be done with a "setter" accessor matched to
the simple "getter".</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="conventions-for-lock-free-code">Conventions for Lock-free
Code</h4>
<p>Sometimes variables are accessed concurrently without appropriate
synchronization context, such as a held mutex or at a safepoint. In such
cases the variable should be declared <code>volatile</code> and it
should NOT be accessed as a normal C++ lvalue. Rather, access should be
performed via functions from <code>Atomic</code>, such as
<code>Atomic::load</code>, <code>Atomic::store</code>, etc.</p>
<p>This special formulation makes it more clear to maintainers that the
variable is accessed concurrently in a lock-free manner.</p>
<h3 id="source-files">Source Files</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>All source files must have a globally unique basename. The build
system depends on this uniqueness.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep the include lines within a section alphabetically sorted by
their lowercase value. If an include must be out of order for
correctness, suffix with it a comment such as
<code>// do not reorder</code>. Source code processing tools can also
use this hint.</p></li>
<li><p>Put conditional inclusions (<code>#if ...</code>) at the end of
the section of HotSpot include lines. This also applies to
macro-expanded includes of platform dependent files.</p></li>
<li><p>Put system includes in a section after the HotSpot include lines
with a blank line separating the two sections.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not put non-trivial function implementations in .hpp files. If
the implementation depends on other .hpp files, put it in a .cpp or a
.inline.hpp file.</p></li>
<li><p>.inline.hpp files should only be included in .cpp or .inline.hpp
files.</p></li>
<li><p>All .inline.hpp files should include their corresponding .hpp
file as the first include line with a blank line separating it from the
rest of the include lines. Declarations needed by other files should be
put in the .hpp file, and not in the .inline.hpp file. This rule exists
to resolve problems with circular dependencies between .inline.hpp
files.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not include a .hpp file if the corresponding .inline.hpp file
is included.</p></li>
<li><p>Use include guards for .hpp and .inline.hpp files. The name of
the defined guard should be derived from the full search path of the
file relative to the hotspot source directory. The guard should be all
upper case with all paths separators and periods replaced by
underscores.</p></li>
<li><p>Some build configurations use precompiled headers to speed up the
build times. The precompiled headers are included in the precompiled.hpp
file. Note that precompiled.hpp is just a build time optimization, so
don't rely on it to resolve include problems.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="jtreg-tests">JTReg Tests</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>JTReg tests should have meaningful names.</p></li>
<li><p>JTReg tests associated with specific bugs should be tagged with
the <code>@bug</code> keyword in the test description.</p></li>
<li><p>JTReg tests should be organized by component or feature under
<code>test/</code>, in a directory hierarchy that generally follows that
of the <code>src/</code> directory. There may be additional
subdirectories to further categorize tests by feature. This structure
makes it easy to run a collection of tests associated with a specific
feature by specifying the associated directory as the source of the
tests to run.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some (older) tests use the associated bug number in the directory
name, the test name, or both. That naming style should no longer be
used, with existing tests using that style being candidates for
migration.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="naming">Naming</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The length of a name may be correlated to the size of its scope.
In particular, short names (even single letter names) may be fine in a
small scope, but are usually inappropriate for larger scopes.</p></li>
<li><p>Prefer whole words rather than abbreviations, unless the
abbreviation is more widely used than the long form in the code's
domain.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose names consistently. Do not introduce spurious variations.
Abbreviate corresponding terms to a consistent length.</p></li>
<li><p>Global names must be unique, to avoid <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition"
title="One Definition Rule">One Definition Rule</a> (ODR) violations. A
common prefixing scheme for related global names is often used. (This is
instead of using namespaces, which are mostly avoided in
HotSpot.)</p></li>
<li><p>Don't give two names to the semantically same thing. But use
different names for semantically different things, even if they are
representationally the same. (So use meaningful <code>typedef</code> or
template alias names where appropriate.)</p></li>
<li><p>When choosing names, avoid categorical nouns like "variable",
"field", "parameter", "value", and verbs like "compute", "get".
(<code>storeValue(int param)</code> is bad.)</p></li>
<li><p>Type names and global names should use mixed-case with the first
letter of each word capitalized (<code>FooBar</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Embedded abbreviations in otherwise mixed-case names are usually
capitalized entirely rather than being treated as a single word with
only the initial letter capitalized, e.g. "HTML" rather than
"Html".</p></li>
<li><p>Function and local variable names use lowercase with words
separated by a single underscore (<code>foo_bar</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Class data member names have a leading underscore, and use
lowercase with words separated by a single underscore
(<code>_foo_bar</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Constant names may be upper-case or mixed-case, according to
historical necessity. (Note: There are many examples of constants with
lowercase names.)</p></li>
<li><p>Constant names should follow an existing pattern, and must have a
distinct appearance from other names in related APIs.</p></li>
<li><p>Class and type names should be noun phrases. Consider an "er"
suffix for a class that represents an action.</p></li>
<li><p>Function names should be verb phrases that reflect changes of
state known to a class's user, or else noun phrases if they cause no
change of state visible to the class's user.</p></li>
<li><p>Getter accessor names are noun phrases, with no
"<code>get_</code>" noise word. Boolean getters can also begin with
"<code>is_</code>" or "<code>has_</code>". Member function for reading
data members usually have the same name as the data member, exclusive of
the leading underscore.</p></li>
<li><p>Setter accessor names prepend "<code>set_</code>" to the getter
name.</p></li>
<li><p>Other member function names are verb phrases, as if commands to
the receiver.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid leading underscores (as "<code>_oop</code>") except in
cases required above. (Names with leading underscores can cause
portability problems.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="commenting">Commenting</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Clearly comment subtle fixes.</p></li>
<li><p>Clearly comment tricky classes and functions.</p></li>
<li><p>If you have to choose between commenting code and writing wiki
content, comment the code. Link from the wiki to the source file if it
makes sense.</p></li>
<li><p>As a general rule don't add bug numbers to comments (they would
soon overwhelm the code). But if the bug report contains significant
information that can't reasonably be added as a comment, then refer to
the bug report.</p></li>
<li><p>Personal names are discouraged in the source code, which is a
team product.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="macros">Macros</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>You can almost always use an inline function or class instead of
a macro. Use a macro only when you really need it.</p></li>
<li><p>Templates may be preferable to multi-line macros. (There may be
subtle performance effects with templates on some platforms; revert to
macros if absolutely necessary.)</p></li>
<li><p><code>#ifdef</code>s should not be used to introduce
platform-specific code into shared code (except for <code>_LP64</code>).
They must be used to manage header files, in the pattern found at the
top of every source file. They should be used mainly for major build
features, including <code>PRODUCT</code>, <code>ASSERT</code>,
<code>_LP64</code>, <code>INCLUDE_SERIALGC</code>,
<code>COMPILER1</code>, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>For build features such as <code>PRODUCT</code>, use
<code>#ifdef PRODUCT</code> for multiple-line inclusions or
exclusions.</p></li>
<li><p>For short inclusions or exclusions based on build features, use
macros like <code>PRODUCT_ONLY</code> and <code>NOT_PRODUCT</code>. But
avoid using them with multiple-line arguments, since debuggers do not
handle that well.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <code>CATCH</code>, <code>THROW</code>, etc. for
HotSpot-specific exception processing.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="whitespace">Whitespace</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>In general, don't change whitespace unless it improves
readability or consistency. Gratuitous whitespace changes will make
integrations and backports more difficult.</p></li>
<li><p>Use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indentation_style#Variant:_1TBS_(OTBS)">One-True-Brace-Style</a>.
The opening brace for a function or class is normally at the end of the
line; it is sometimes moved to the beginning of the next line for
emphasis. Substatements are enclosed in braces, even if there is only a
single statement. Extremely simple one-line statements may drop braces
around a substatement.</p></li>
<li><p>Indentation levels are two columns.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no hard line length limit. That said, bear in mind that
excessively long lines can cause difficulties. Some people like to have
multiple side-by-side windows in their editors, and long lines may force
them to choose among unpleasant options. They can use wide windows,
reducing the number that can fit across the screen, and wasting a lot of
screen real estate because most lines are not that long. Alternatively,
they can have more windows across the screen, with long lines wrapping
(or worse, requiring scrolling to see in their entirety), which is
harder to read. Similar issues exist for side-by-side code
reviews.</p></li>
<li><p>Tabs are not allowed in code. Set your editor accordingly.<br>
(Emacs: <code>(setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil)</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use good taste to break lines and align corresponding tokens on
adjacent lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Use spaces around operators, especially comparisons and
assignments. (Relaxable for boolean expressions and high-precedence
operators in classic math-style formulas.)</p></li>
<li><p>Put spaces on both sides of control flow keywords
<code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, <code>for</code>,
<code>switch</code>, etc. Don't add spaces around the associated
<em>control</em> expressions. Examples:</p>
<pre><code>while (test_foo(args...)) {   // Yes
while(test_foo(args...)) {    // No, missing space after while
while ( test_foo(args...) ) { // No, excess spaces around control</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Use extra parentheses in expressions whenever operator precedence
seems doubtful. Always use parentheses in shift/mask expressions
(<code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>). Don't add
whitespace immediately inside parentheses.</p></li>
<li><p>Use more spaces and blank lines between larger constructs, such
as classes or function definitions.</p></li>
<li><p>If the surrounding code has any sort of vertical organization,
adjust new lines horizontally to be consistent with that organization.
(E.g., trailing backslashes on long macro definitions often
align.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="avoid-implicit-conversions-to-bool">Avoid implicit conversions
to bool</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use <code>bool</code> for boolean values.</li>
<li>Do not use ints or pointers as (implicit) booleans with
<code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>if</code>,
<code>while</code>. Instead, compare explicitly, i.e.
<code>if (x != 0)</code> or <code>if (ptr != nullptr)</code>, etc.</li>
<li>Do not use non-boolean declarations in <em>condition</em> forms,
i.e. don't use <code>if (T v = value) { ... }</code>. But see <a
href="#enhanced-selection-statements">Enhanced selection
statements</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Use the <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii"
title="Resource Acquisition Is Initialization">Resource Acquisition Is
Initialization</a> (RAII) design pattern to manage bracketed critical
sections. See class <code>ResourceMark</code> for an example.</p></li>
<li><p>Use functions from globalDefinitions.hpp and related files when
performing bitwise operations on integers. Do not code directly as C
operators, unless they are extremely simple. (Examples:
<code>align_up</code>, <code>is_power_of_2</code>,
<code>exact_log2</code>.)</p></li>
<li><p>Use arrays with abstractions supporting range checks.</p></li>
<li><p>Always enumerate all cases in a switch statement or provide a
default case. It is ok to have an empty default with comment.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-of-c-features">Use of C++ Features</h2>
<p>HotSpot was originally written in a subset of the C++98/03 language.
More recently, support for C++17 is provided, though again, HotSpot only
uses a subset. (Backports to JDK versions lacking support for more
recent Standards must of course stick with the original C++98/03
subset.)</p>
<p>This section describes that subset. Features from the C++98/03
language may be used unless explicitly forbidden here. Features from
C++11, C++14, and C++17 may be explicitly permitted or explicitly
forbidden, and discussed accordingly here. There is a third category,
undecided features, about which HotSpot developers have not yet reached
a consensus, or perhaps have not discussed at all. Use of these features
is also forbidden.</p>
<p>(The use of some features may not be immediately obvious and may slip
in anyway, since the compiler will accept them. The code review process
is the main defense against this.)</p>
<p>Some features are discussed in their own subsection, typically to
provide more extensive discussion or rationale for limitations. Features
that don't have their own subsection are listed in omnibus feature
sections for permitted, forbidden, and undecided features.</p>
<p>Lists of new features for C++11, C++14, and C++17, along with links
to their descriptions, can be found in the online documentation for some
of the compilers and libraries. The C++17 Standard is the definitive
description.</p>

<h3 id="error-handling">Error Handling</h3>
<p>Do not use exceptions. Exceptions are disabled by the build
configuration for some platforms.</p>
<p>Rationale: There is significant concern over the performance cost of
exceptions and their usage model and implications for maintainable code.
That's not just a matter of history that has been fixed; there remain
questions and problems even today (2019). See, for example, <a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2018/p0709r0.pdf">Zero
cost deterministic exceptions</a>. Because of this, HotSpot has always
used a build configuration that disables exceptions where that is
available. As a result, HotSpot code uses error handling mechanisms such
as two-phase construction, factory functions, returning error codes, and
immediate termination. Even if the cost of exceptions were not a
concern, the existing body of code was not written with exception safety
in mind. Making HotSpot exception safe would be a very large
undertaking.</p>
<p>In addition to the usual alternatives to exceptions, HotSpot provides
its own exception mechanism. This is based on a set of macros defined in
utilities/exceptions.hpp.</p>
<h3 id="rtti-runtime-type-information">RTTI (Runtime Type
Information)</h3>
<p>Do not use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information"
title="Runtime Type Information">Runtime Type Information</a> (RTTI). <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information"
title="Runtime Type Information">RTTI</a> is disabled by the build
configuration for some platforms. Among other things, this means
<code>dynamic_cast</code> cannot be used.</p>
<p>Rationale: Other than to implement exceptions (which HotSpot doesn't
use), most potential uses of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information"
title="Runtime Type Information">RTTI</a> are better done via virtual
functions. Some of the remainder can be replaced by bespoke mechanisms.
The cost of the additional runtime data structures needed to support <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information"
title="Runtime Type Information">RTTI</a> are deemed not worthwhile,
given the alternatives.</p>
<h3 id="memory-allocation">Memory Allocation</h3>
<p>Do not use the standard global allocation and deallocation functions
(global <code>operator new</code> and related functions), other than the
non-allocating forms of those functions. Use of these functions by
HotSpot code is disabled for some platforms.</p>
<p>Rationale: HotSpot often uses "resource" or "arena" allocation. Even
where heap allocation is used, the standard global functions are avoided
in favor of wrappers around <code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code>
that support the JVM's Native Memory Tracking (NMT) feature. Typically,
uses of the global <code>operator new</code> are inadvertent and
therefore often associated with memory leaks.</p>
<p>Native memory allocation failures are often treated as
non-recoverable. The place where "out of memory" is (first) detected may
be an innocent bystander, unrelated to the actual culprit.</p>
<h3 id="class-inheritance">Class Inheritance</h3>
<p>Use public single inheritance.</p>
<p>Prefer composition rather than non-public inheritance.</p>
<p>Restrict inheritance to the "is-a" case; use composition rather than
non-is-a related inheritance.</p>
<p>Avoid multiple inheritance. Never use virtual inheritance.</p>
<h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3>
<p>Avoid using namespaces. HotSpot code normally uses "all static"
classes rather than namespaces for grouping. An "all static" class is
not instantiable, has only static members, and is normally derived
(possibly indirectly) from the helper class <code>AllStatic</code>.</p>
<p>Benefits of using such classes include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Provides access control for members, which is unavailable with
namespaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoids <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/adl"
title="Argument Dependent Lookup">Argument Dependent Lookup</a>
(ADL).</p></li>
<li><p>Closed for additional members. Namespaces allow names to be added
in multiple contexts, making it harder to see the complete API.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Namespaces should be used only in cases where one of those "benefits"
is actually a hindrance.</p>
<p>In particular, don't use anonymous namespaces. They seem like they
should be useful, and indeed have some real benefits for naming and
generated code size on some platforms. Unfortunately, debuggers don't
seem to like them at all.</p>

<h3 id="c-standard-library">C++ Standard Library</h3>
<p>Only curated parts of the C++ Standard Library may be used by HotSpot
code.</p>
<p>Functions that may throw exceptions must not be used. This is in
accordance with the HotSpot policy of <a href="#error-handling">not
using exceptions</a>.</p>
<p>Also in accordance with HotSpot policy, the <a
href="#memory-allocation">standard global allocator must not be
used</a>. This means that uses of standard container classes cannot
presently be used, as doing so requires specialization on some allocator
type that is integrated with the existing HotSpot allocation mechanisms.
(Such allocators may be provided in the future.)</p>
<p>Standard Library identifiers should usually be fully qualified;
<code>using</code> directives must not be used to bring Standard Library
identifiers into scope just to remove the need for namespace
qualification. Requiring qualification makes it easy to distinguish
between references to external libraries and code that is part of
HotSpot.</p>
<p>As with language features, Standard Library facilities are either
permitted, explicitly forbidden, or undecided (and so implicitly
forbidden).</p>
<p>Most HotSpot code should not directly <code>#include</code> C++
Standard Library headers. HotSpot provides a set of wrapper headers for
the Standard Library headers containing permitted definitions. These
wrappers are in the <code>cppstdlib</code> directory, with the same name
as the corresponding Standard Library header and a <code>.hpp</code>
extension. These wrappers provide a place for any additional code (some
of which may be platform-specific) needed to support HotSpot usage.</p>
<p>These wrappers also provide a place to document HotSpot usage,
including any restrictions. The set of wrappers and the usage
documentation should be considered part of HotSpot style. Any changes
are subject to the same process as applies to this document. (For
historical reasons, there may be many direct inclusions of some C++
Standard Library headers.)</p>
<p>Historically, HotSpot has mostly avoided use of the Standard
Library.</p>
<p>(It used to be impossible to use most of it in shared code, because
the build configuration for Solaris with Solaris Studio made all but a
couple of pieces inaccessible. Support for header-only parts was added
in mid-2017. Support for Solaris was removed in 2020.)</p>
<p>Some reasons for this include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Exceptions. Perhaps the largest core issue with adopting the use
of Standard Library facilities is exceptions. HotSpot does not use
exceptions and, for platforms which allow doing so, builds with them
turned off. Many Standard Library facilities implicitly or explicitly
use exceptions. On the other hand, many don't, and can be used without
concern for this issue. Others may have a useful subset that doesn't use
exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p><code>assert</code>. An issue that is quickly encountered is the
<code>assert</code> macro name collision (<a
href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8007770">JDK-8007770</a>).
(Not all Standard Library implementations use <code>assert</code> in
header files, but some do.) HotSpot provides a mechanism for addressing
this, by establishing a scope around the include of a library header
where the HotSpot <code>assert</code> macro is suppressed. One of the
reasons for using wrapper headers rather than directly including
standard headers is to provide a central place to deal with this issue
for each header.</p></li>
<li><p>Memory allocation. HotSpot requires explicit control over where
allocations occur. The C++98/03 <code>std::allocator</code> class is too
limited to support our usage. But changes to the allocator concept in
more recent Standards removed some of the limitations, supporting
stateful allocators. HotSpot may, in the future, provide
standard-conforming allocators that are integrated with HotSpot's
existing allocation mechanisms.</p></li>
<li><p>Implementation vagaries. Bugs, or simply different implementation
choices, can lead to different behaviors among the various Standard
Libraries we need to deal with. But only selected parts of the Standard
Library are being permitted, and one of the selection criteria is
maturity. Some of these facilities are among the most heavily tested and
used C++ codes that exist.</p></li>
<li><p>Inconsistent naming conventions. HotSpot and the C++ Standard use
different naming conventions. The coexistence of those different
conventions might appear jarring and reduce readability. However,
experience in some other code bases suggests this isn't a significant
problem, so long as Standard Library names are namespace-qualified. It
is tempting to bring the Standard Library names into scope via a
<code>using std;</code> directive. Doing so makes writing code using
those names easier, since the qualifiers don't need to be included. But
there are several reasons not to do that.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a risk of future name collisions. Additional Standard
Library headers may be included, adding to the list of names being used.
Also, future versions of the Standard Library may add currently unknown
names to the headers already being included.</p></li>
<li><p>It may harm readability. Code where this is relevant is a mixture
of the local HotSpot naming conventions and the Standard Library's (or
other 3rd-party library's) naming conventions. With only unqualified
names, any distinctions from the naming conventions for the different
code sources are lost. Instead one may end up with an undifferentiated
mess, where it's not obvious whether an identifier is from local code
that is inconsistent with HotSpot style (and there's a regretable amount
of that for historical reasons), or is following some other convention.
Having the qualifiers disambiguates that.</p></li>
<li><p>It can be helpful to know, at a glance, whether the definition is
in HotSpot or elsewhere, for purposes of looking up the definition or
documentation.</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="type-deduction">Type Deduction</h3>
<p>Use type deduction only if it makes the code clearer or safer. Do not
use it merely to avoid the inconvenience of writing an explicit type,
unless that type is itself difficult to write. An example of the latter
is a function template return type that depends on template parameters
in a non-trivial way.</p>
<p>There are several contexts where types are deduced.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Function argument deduction. This is always permitted, and indeed
encouraged. It is nearly always better to allow the type of a function
template argument to be deduced rather than explicitly
specified.</p></li>
<li><p><code>auto</code> variable declarations (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2006/n1984.pdf">n1984</a>)<br>
For local variables, this can be used to make the code clearer by
eliminating type information that is obvious or irrelevant. Excessive
use can make code much harder to understand.</p></li>
<li><p><code>auto</code> for non-type template parameters (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0127r2">p0127r2</a>)<br> <code>auto</code> may
be used as a placeholder for the type of a non-type template parameter.
The type is deduced from the value provided in a template
instantiation.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><a name="function-return-type-deduction"></a> * Function return type
deduction (<a
href="https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3638.html">n3638</a>)<br> Only
use if the function body has a very small number of <code>return</code>
statements, and generally relatively little other code.</p>
<ul>
<li>Class template argument deduction (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n3602">n3602</a>, <a
href="http://wg21.link/p0091r3">p0091r3</a>)<br> The template arguments
of a class template may be deduced from the arguments to a constructor.
This is similar to ordinary function argument deduction, though partial
deduction with only <em>some</em> template arguments explicitly provided
is not permitted for class template argument deduction. Deduction guides
may be used to provide additional control over the deduction. As with
<code>auto</code> variable declarations, excessive use can make code
harder to understand, because explicit type information is lacking. But
it can also remove the need to be explicit about types that are either
obvious, or that are very hard to write. For example, these allow the
addition of a scope-guard mechanism with nice syntax; something like
this</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>  ScopeGuard guard{[&amp;]{ ... cleanup code ... }};</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p>Also see <a href="#lambdaexpressions">lambda
expressions</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>decltype(auto)</code> should be avoided, whether for
variables, for non-type template parameters, or for function return
types. There are subtle and complex differences between this placeholder
type and <code>auto</code>. Any use would need very careful
explanation.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="expression-sfinae">Expression SFINAE</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae"
title="Substitution Failure Is Not An Error">Substitution Failure Is Not
An Error</a> (SFINAE) is a template metaprogramming technique that makes
use of template parameter substitution failures to make compile-time
decisions.</p>
<p>C++11 relaxed the rules for what constitutes a hard-error when
attempting to substitute template parameters with template arguments,
making most deduction errors be substitution errors; see (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2634.html">n2634</a>).
This makes <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae"
title="Substitution Failure Is Not An Error">SFINAE</a> more powerful
and easier to use. However, the implementation complexity for this
change is significant, and this seems to be a place where obscure
corner-case bugs in various compilers can be found. So while this
feature can (and indeed should) be used (and would be difficult to
avoid), caution should be used when pushing to extremes.</p>
<p>Here are a few closely related example bugs:<br> <a
href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95468"
class="uri">https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=95468</a><br>

<h3 id="trailing-return-type-syntax-for-functions">Trailing return type
syntax for functions</h3>
<p>A function's return type may be specified after the parameters and
qualifiers (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2541.htm">n2541</a>).
In such a declaration the normal return type is <code>auto</code> and
the return type is indicated by <code>-&gt;</code> followed by the type.
Although both use <code>auto</code> in the "normal" leading return type
position, this differs from <a
href="#function-return-type-deduction">function return type
deduction</a>, in that the return type is explicit rather than deduced,
but specified in a trailing position.</p>
<p>Use of trailing return types is permitted. However, the normal,
leading position for the return type is preferred. A trailing return
type should only be used where it provides some benefit. Such benefits
usually arise because a trailing return type is in a different scope
than a leading return type.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the function identifier is a nested name specifier, then the
trailing return type occurs in the nested scope. This may permit simpler
naming in the return type because of the different name lookup
context.</p></li>
<li><p>The trailing return type is in the scope of the parameters,
making their types accessible via <code>decltype</code>. For
example</p></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>template&lt;typename T, typename U&gt; auto add(T t, U u) -&gt; decltype(t + u);</code></pre>
<p>rather than</p>
<pre><code>template&lt;typename T, typename U&gt; decltype((*(T*)0) + (*(U*)0)) add(T t, U u);</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>Complex calculated leading return types may obscure the normal
syntactic boundaries, making it more difficult for a reader to find the
function name and parameters. This is particularly common in cases where
the return type is being used for <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae"
title="Substitution Failure Is Not An Error">SFINAE</a>. A trailing
return type may be preferable in such situations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="non-type-template-parameter-values">Non-type template parameter
values</h3>
<p>C++17 extended the arguments permitted for non-type template
parameters (<a href="http://wg21.link/n4268">n4268</a>). The kinds of
values (the parameter types) aren't changed. However, the values can now
be the result of arbitrary constant expressions (with a few restrictions
on the result), rather than a much more limited and restrictive set of
expressions. In particular, the argument for a pointer or reference type
parameter can now be the result of a constexpr function.</p>
<h3 id="enum">enum</h3>
<p>Where appropriate, <em>scoped-enums</em> should be used. (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2347.pdf">n2347</a>)</p>
<p>Use of <em>unscoped-enums</em> is permitted, though ordinary
constants may be preferable when the automatic initializer feature isn't
used.</p>
<p>The underlying type (the <em>enum-base</em>) of an unscoped enum type
should always be specified explicitly. When unspecified, the underlying
type is dependent on the range of the enumerator values and the
platform.</p>
<p>The underlying type of a <em>scoped-enum</em> should also be
specified explicitly if conversions may be applied to values of that
type.</p>
<p>Due to bugs in certain (very old) compilers, there is widespread use
of enums and avoidance of in-class initialization of static integral
constant members. Compilers having such bugs are no longer supported.
Except where an enum is semantically appropriate, new code should use
integral constants.</p>
<h3 id="alignas">alignas</h3>
<p><em>Alignment-specifiers</em> (<code>alignas</code> <a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2341.pdf">n2341</a>)
are permitted, with restrictions.</p>
<p><em>Alignment-specifiers</em> are permitted when the requested
alignment is a <em>fundamental alignment</em> (not greater than
<code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code> <a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf">C++14
3.11/2</a>).</p>
<p><em>Alignment-specifiers</em> with an <em>extended alignment</em>
(greater than <code>alignof(std::max_align_t)</code> <a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf">C++14
3.11/3</a>) may only be used to align variables with static or automatic
storage duration (<a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf">C++14
3.7.1, 3.7.3</a>). As a consequence, <em>over-aligned types</em> are
forbidden; this may change if HotSpot updates to using C++17 or later
(<a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0035r4.html">p0035r4</a>).</p>
<p>Large <em>extended alignments</em> should be avoided, particularly
for stack allocated objects. What is a large value may depend on the
platform and configuration. There may also be hard limits for some
platforms.</p>
<p>An <em>alignment-specifier</em> must always be applied to a
definition (<a
href="https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n4296.pdf">C++14
10.6.2/6</a>). (C++ allows an <em>alignment-specifier</em> to optionally
also be applied to a declaration, so long as the definition has
equivalent alignment. There isn't any known benefit from duplicating the
alignment in a non-definition declaration, so such duplication should be
avoided in HotSpot code.)</p>
<p>Enumerations are forbidden from having <em>alignment-specifiers</em>.
Aligned enumerations were originally permitted but insufficiently
specified, and were later (C++20) removed (<a
href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/2354.html">CWG 2354</a>).
Permitting such usage in HotSpot now would just cause problems in the
future.</p>
<p><em>Alignment-specifiers</em> are forbidden in <code>typedef</code>
and <em>alias-declarations</em>. This may work or may have worked in
some versions of some compilers, but was later (C++14) explicitly
disallowed (<a
href="https://cplusplus.github.io/CWG/issues/1437.html">CWG
1437</a>).</p>
<p>The HotSpot macro <code>ATTRIBUTE_ALIGNED</code> provides similar
capabilities for platforms that define it. This macro predates the use
by HotSpot of C++ versions providing <code>alignas</code>. New code
should use <code>alignas</code>.</p>
<h3 id="thread_local">thread_local</h3>
<p>Avoid use of <code>thread_local</code> (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2659.htm">n2659</a>);
and instead, use the HotSpot macro <code>THREAD_LOCAL</code>, for which
the initializer must be a constant expression. When
<code>thread_local</code> must be used, use the Hotspot macro
<code>APPROVED_CPP_THREAD_LOCAL</code> to indicate that the use has been
given appropriate consideration.</p>
<p>As was discussed in the review for <a
href="https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/hotspot-dev/2019-September/039487.html">JDK-8230877</a>,
<code>thread_local</code> allows dynamic initialization and destruction
semantics. However, that support requires a run-time penalty for
references to non-function-local <code>thread_local</code> variables
defined in a different translation unit, even if they don't need dynamic
initialization. Dynamic initialization and destruction of non-local
<code>thread_local</code> variables also has the same ordering problems
as for ordinary non-local variables. So we avoid use of
<code>thread_local</code> in general, limiting its use to only those
cases where dynamic initialization or destruction are essential. See <a
href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8282469">JDK-8282469</a> for
further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="nullptr">nullptr</h3>
<p>Use <code>nullptr</code> (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2431.pdf">n2431</a>)
rather than <code>NULL</code>. See the paper for reasons to avoid
<code>NULL</code>.</p>
<p>Don't use (constant expression or literal) 0 for pointers. Note that
C++14 removed non-literal 0 constants from <em>null pointer
constants</em>, though some compilers continue to treat them as
such.</p>
<h3 id="atomic">&lt;atomic&gt;</h3>
<p>Do not use facilities provided by the <code>&lt;atomic&gt;</code>
header (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2427.html">n2427</a>),
(<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2752.htm">n2752</a>);
instead, use the HotSpot <code>Atomic</code> class and related
facilities.</p>
<p>Atomic operations in HotSpot code must have semantics which are
consistent with those provided by the JDK's compilers for Java. There
are platform-specific implementation choices that a C++ compiler might
make or change that are outside the scope of the C++ Standard, and might
differ from what the Java compilers implement.</p>
<p>In addition, HotSpot <code>Atomic</code> has a concept of
"conservative" memory ordering, which may differ from (may be stronger
than) sequentially consistent. There are algorithms in HotSpot that are
believed to rely on that ordering.</p>
<h3 id="variable-templates-and-inline-variables">Variable Templates and
Inline Variables</h3>
<p>The use of variable templates (including static data member
templates) (<a href="https://wg21.link/N3651">N3651</a>) is permitted.
They provide parameterized variables and constants in a simple and
direct form, instead of requiring the use of various workarounds.</p>
<p>Variables with static storage duration and variable templates may be
declared <code>inline</code> (<a
href="https://wg21.link/p0386r2">p0386r2</a>), and this usage is
permitted. This has similar effects as for declaring a function inline:
it can be defined, identically, in multiple translation units, must be
defined in every translation unit in which it is <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/definition"
title="One Definition Rule">ODR used</a>, and the behavior of the
program is as if there is exactly one variable.</p>
<p>Declaring a variable inline allows the complete definition to be in a
header file, rather than having a declaration in a header and the
definition in a .cpp file. The guidance on <a
href="#initializing-variables-with-static-storage-duration">initialization</a>
of such variables still applies. Inline variables with dynamic
initializations can make initialization order problems worse. The few
ordering constraints that exist for non-inline variables don't apply, as
there isn't a single program-designated translation unit containing the
definition.</p>
<p>A <code>constexpr</code> static data member or static data member
template is implicitly <code>inline</code>. As a consequence, an <a

<p>Variables with static storage duration and non-trivial destructors

<p>Some of the approaches used in HotSpot to avoid dynamic

a call to its initialization function at an appropriate place during VM
initialization. The underlying object is never destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p>For objects of class type, use a variable whose value is a

<h3 id="mandatory-copy-elision">Mandatory Copy Elision</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision">Copy elision</a>
(or <a
href="https://cn.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision.html">here</a>)
is a compiler optimization used to avoid potentially expensive copies in
certain situations. It is critical to making practical the performance
of return by value or pass by value. It is also unusual in not following
the as-if rule for optimizations - copy elision can be applied even if
doing so bypasses side-effects of copying/moving the object. The C++
standard explicitly permits this.</p>
<p>However, because it's an optional optimization, the relevant
copy/move constructor must be available and accessible, in case the
compiler chooses to not apply the optimization even in a situation where
permitted.</p>
<p>C++17 changed some cases of copy elision so that there is never a
copy/move in these cases (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0135r1">p0135r1</a>). The interesting cases
involve a function that returns an unnamed temporary object, and
constructors. In such cases the object being initialized from the
temporary is always direct initialized, with no copy/move ever involved;
see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision#RVO"
title="Return Value Optimization">RVO</a> and more specifically <a
href="https://cn.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/copy_elision.html"
title="Unnamed Return Value Optimization">URVO</a>.</p>
<p>Since this is now standard behavior it can't be avoided in the
covered situations. This could change the behavior of code that relied
on side effects by constructors, but that's both uncommon and was
already problematic because of the previous optional copy elision. But
HotSpot code can, and should, explicitly take advantage of this newly
required behavior where it makes sense to do so.</p>
<p>For example, it may be beneficial to delay construction of the result
of a function until the return statement, rather than having a local
variable that is modified into the desired state and then returned.
(Though <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy_elision#NRVO"
title="Named Return Value Optimization">NRVO</a> may apply in that
case.)</p>
<p>It is also now possible to define a factory function for a class that
is neither movable nor copyable, if it can be written in a way that
makes use of this feature.</p>
<h3 id="local-function-objects">Local Function Objects</h3>
<ul>
<li>Local function objects, including lambda expressions, may be
used.</li>
<li>Lambda expressions must only be used as a downward value.</li>
<li>Prefer <code>[&amp;]</code> as the capture list of a lambda
expression.</li>
<li>Return type deduction for lambda expressions is permitted, and

<li>An empty parameter list for a lambda expression may be elided.</li>
<li>A lambda expression must not be <code>mutable</code>.</li>
<li>Generic lambda expressions are permitted.</li>
<li>Lambda expressions should be relatively simple.</li>
<li>Anonymous lambda expressions should not overly clutter the enclosing

<li>An anonymous lambda expression must not be directly invoked.</li>
<li>Bind expressions are forbidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>Single-use function objects can be defined locally within a function,
directly at the point of use. This is an alternative to having a
function or function object class defined at class or namespace
scope.</p>
<p>This usage was somewhat limited by C++03, which does not permit such
a class to be used as a template parameter. That restriction was removed
by C++11 (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2657.htm">n2657</a>).
Use of this feature is permitted.</p>
<p>Many HotSpot protocols involve "function-like" objects that involve
some named member function rather than a call operator. For example, a
function that performs some action on all threads might be written
as</p>
<pre><code>void do_something() {
  struct DoSomething : public ThreadClosure {
    virtual void do_thread(Thread* t) {
      ... do something with t ...
    }
  } closure;
  Threads::threads_do(&amp;closure);
}</code></pre>
<p>HotSpot code has historically usually placed the DoSomething class at
namespace (or sometimes class) scope. This separates the function's code
from its use, often to the detriment of readability. It requires giving
the class a globally unique name (if at namespace scope). It also loses
the information that the class is intended for use in exactly one place,
and does not have any subclasses. (However, the latter can now be
indicated by declaring it <code>final</code>.) Often, for simplicity, a
local class will skip things like access control and accessor functions,
giving the enclosing function direct access to the implementation and
eliminating some boilerplate that might be provided if the class is in
some outer (more accessible) scope. On the other hand, if there is a lot
of surrounding code in the function body or the local class is of
significant size, defining it locally can increase clutter and reduce
readability.</p>
<p><a name="lambdaexpressions"></a> C++11 added <em>lambda
expressions</em> as a new way to write a function object. Simple lambda
expressions can be significantly more concise than a function object,
eliminating a lot of boiler-plate. On the other hand, a complex lambda
expression may not provide much, if any, readability benefit compared to
an ordinary function object. Also, while a lambda can encapsulate a call
to a "function-like" object, it cannot be used in place of such.</p>
<p>A common use for local functions is as one-use <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/raii"
title="Resource Acquisition Is Initialization">RAII</a> objects. The
amount of boilerplate for a function object class (local or not) makes
such usage somewhat clumsy and verbose. But with the help of a small
amount of supporting utility code, lambdas work particularly well for
this use case.</p>
<p>Another use for local functions is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application"
title="Partial Application">partial application</a>. Again here, lambdas
are typically much simpler and less verbose than function object
classes.</p>
<p>A lambda is a constexpr function if either the parameter declaration
clause is followed by <code>constexpr</code>, or it satisfies the
requirements for a constexpr function (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0170r1.pdf">p0170r1</a>).
Thus, using a lambda to package up some computation doesn't incur
unnecessary overhead or prevent use in a context required to be
compile-time evaluated (such as an array size).</p>
<p>Because of these benefits, lambda expressions are permitted in
HotSpot code, with some restrictions and usage guidance. An anonymous
lambda is one which is passed directly as an argument. A named lambda is
the value of a variable, which is its name.</p>
<p>Lambda expressions should only be passed downward. In particular, a
lambda should not be returned from a function or stored in a global
variable, whether directly or as the value of a member of some other
object. Lambda capture is syntactically subtle (by design), and
propagating a lambda in such ways can easily pass references to captured
values to places where they are no longer valid. In particular, members
of the enclosing <code>this</code> object are effectively captured by
reference, even if the default capture is by-value. For such uses-cases
a function object class should be used to make the desired value
capturing and propagation explicit.</p>
<p>Limiting the capture list to <code>[&amp;]</code> (implicitly capture
by reference) is a simplifying restriction that still provides good
support for HotSpot usage, while reducing the cases a reader must
recognize and understand.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Many common lambda uses require reference capture. Not permitting
it would substantially reduce the utility of lambdas.</p></li>
<li><p>Referential transparency. Implicit reference capture makes
variable references in the lambda body have the same meaning they would
have in the enclosing code. There isn't a semantic barrier across which
the meaning of a variable changes.</p></li>
<li><p>Explicit reference capture introduces significant clutter,
especially when lambda expressions are relatively small and simple, as
they should be in HotSpot code.</p></li>
<li><p>There are a number of reasons why by-value capture might be used,
but for the most part they don't apply to HotSpot code, given other
usage restrictions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A primary use-case for by-value capture is to support escaping
uses, where values captured by-reference might become invalid. That
use-case doesn't apply if only downward lambdas are used.</p></li>
<li><p>By-value capture can also make a lambda-local copy for mutation,
which requires making the lambda <code>mutable</code>; see
below.</p></li>
<li><p>By-value capture might be viewed as an optimization, avoiding any
overhead for reference capture of cheap to copy values. But the compiler
can often eliminate any such overhead.</p></li>
<li><p>By-value capture by a non-<code>mutable</code> lambda makes the
captured values const, preventing any modification by the lambda and
making the captured value unaffected by modifications to the outer
variable. But this only applies to captured auto variables, not member
variables, and is inconsistent with referential transparency.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>By-value capture of <code>this</code> (using a capture list like
<code>[*this]</code> (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2016/p0018r3.html">p0018r3</a>))
is also not permitted. One of the motivating use-cases is when the
lifetime of the lambda exceeds the lifetime of the object for the
containing member function. That is, we have an upward lambda that is
capturing <code>this</code> of the enclosing method. But again, that
use-case doesn't apply if only downward lambdas are used. Another
use-case is when we simply want the lambda to be operating on a copy of
<code>this</code> for some reason. This is sufficiently uncommon that it
can be handled by manual copying, so readers don't need to understand
this rare syntax.</p></li>
<li><p>Non-capturing lambdas (with an empty capture list -
<code>[]</code>) have limited utility. There are cases where no captures
are required (pure functions, for example), but if the function is small
and simple then that's obvious anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Capture initializers (a C++14 feature - <a
href="https://isocpp.org/files/papers/N3649.html">N3649</a>) are not
permitted. Capture initializers inherently increase the complexity of
the capture list, and provide little benefit over an additional in-scope
local variable.</p></li>
<li><p>The use of <code>mutable</code> lambda expressions is forbidden
because there don't seem to be many, if any, good use-cases for them in
HotSpot. A lambda expression needs to be mutable in order to modify a
by-value captured value. But with only downward lambdas, such usage
seems likely to be rare and complicated. It is better to use a function
object class in any such cases that arise, rather than requiring all
HotSpot developers to understand this relatively obscure
feature.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While it is possible to directly invoke an anonymous lambda
expression, that feature should not be used, as such a form can be
confusing to readers. Instead, name the lambda and call it by name.</p>
<p>Some reasons to prefer a named lambda instead of an anonymous lambda
are</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The body contains non-trivial control flow or declarations or
other nested constructs.</p></li>
<li><p>Its role in an argument list is hard to guess without examining
the function declaration. Give it a name that indicates its
purpose.</p></li>
<li><p>It has an unusual capture list.</p></li>
<li><p>It has a complex explicit return type or parameter
types.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Lambda expressions, and particularly anonymous lambda expressions,
should be simple and compact. One-liners are good. Anonymous lambdas
should usually be limited to a couple lines of body code. More complex
lambdas should be named. A named lambda should not clutter the enclosing
function and make it long and complex; do continue to break up large
functions via the use of separate helper functions.</p>
<p>An anonymous lambda expression should either be a one-liner in a
one-line expression, or isolated in its own set of lines. Don't place
part of a lambda expression on the same line as other arguments to a
function. The body of a multi-line lambda argument should be indented
from the start of the capture list, as if that were the start of an
ordinary function definition. The body of a multi-line named lambda
should be indented one step from the variable's indentation.</p>
<p>Some examples:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><code>foo([&amp;] { ++counter; });</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>foo(x, [&amp;] { ++counter; });</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>foo([&amp;] { if (predicate) ++counter; });</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>foo([&amp;] { auto tmp = process(x); tmp.f(); return tmp.g(); })</code></p></li>
<li><p>Separate one-line lambda from other arguments:</p>
<pre><code>foo(c.begin(), c.end(),
    [&amp;] (const X&amp; x) { do_something(x); return x.value(); });</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Indentation for multi-line lambda:</p>
<pre><code>c.do_entries([&amp;] (const X&amp; x) {
               do_something(x, a);
               do_something1(x, b);
               do_something2(x, c);
             });</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Separate multi-line lambda from other arguments:</p>
<pre><code>foo(c.begin(), c.end(),
    [&amp;] (const X&amp; x) {
      do_something(x, a);
      do_something1(x, b);
      do_something2(x, c);
    });</code></pre></li>
<li><p>Multi-line named lambda:</p>
<pre><code>auto do_entry = [&amp;] (const X&amp; x) {
  do_something(x, a);
  do_something1(x, b);
  do_something2(x, c);
};</code></pre></li>
</ol>
<p>Item 4, and especially items 6 and 7, are pushing the simplicity
limits for anonymous lambdas. Item 6 might be better written using a
named lambda:</p>
<pre><code>c.do_entries(do_entry);</code></pre>
<p>Note that C++11 also added <em>bind expressions</em> as a way to
write a function object for partial application, using
<code>std::bind</code> and related facilities from the Standard Library.
<code>std::bind</code> generalizes and replaces some of the binders from
C++03. Bind expressions are not permitted in HotSpot code. They don't
provide enough benefit over lambdas or local function classes in the
cases where bind expressions are applicable to warrant the introduction
of yet another mechanism in this space into HotSpot code.</p>

<p>C++11 provides simple syntax allowing a class to inherit the
constructors of a base class. Unfortunately there are a number of
problems with the original specification, and C++17 contains significant
revisions (<a href="http:/wg21.link/p0136r1" title="p0136r1">p0136r1</a>
opens with a list of 8 Core Issues). Although those issues have been
addressed, the benefits from this feature are small compared to the
complexity. Because of this, HotSpot code must not use inherited
constructors.</p>

<h3 id="attributes">Attributes</h3>
<p>The use of some attributes (<a

(listed below) is permitted. (Note that some of the attributes defined
in that paper didn't make it into the final specification.)</p>
<p>Attributes are syntactically permitted in a broad set of locations,
but specific attributes are only permitted in a subset of those
locations. In some cases an attribute that appertains to a given element
may be placed in any of several locations with the same meaning. In
those cases HotSpot has a preferred location.</p>
<ul>
<li>An attribute that appertains to a function is placed at the
beginning of the function's declaration, rather than between the
function name and the parameter list.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://wg21.link/p0068r0">p0068r0</a> is the initial
proposal for the attributes added by C++17.)</p>
<p>Only the following attributes are permitted:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[[noreturn]]</code></li>
<li><code>[[nodiscard]]</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0189r1">p0189r1</a>)</li>
<li><code>[[maybe_unused]]</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0212r1">p0212r1</a>)</li>
<li><code>[[fallthrough]]</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0188">p0188r1</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>The following attributes are expressly forbidden:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[[carries_dependency]]</code> - Related to
<code>memory_order_consume</code>.</li>
<li><code>[[deprecated]]</code> - Not relevant in HotSpot code.</li>
</ul>
<p>Direct use of non-standard (and presumably scoped) attributes in
shared code is also forbidden. Using such would depend on the C++17
feature that an attribute not recognized by the implementation is
ignored (<a href="http://wg21.link/p0283r2">p0283r2</a>). If such an
attribute is needed in shared code, the well-established technique of
providing an <code>ATTRIBUTE_XXX</code> macro with per-compiler
definitions (sometimes empty) should be used. Compilers may warn about
unrecognized attributes (whether by name or by location), in order to
report typos or misuse. Disabling such warnings globally would not be
desirable.</p>
<p>The use of <code>using</code> directives in attribute lists is also
forbidden. (<a href="http://wg21.link/p0028r0">p0028r0</a>) (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0028r4">p0028r4</a>) We don't generally use
scoped attributes in attribute lists with other attributes. Rather, uses
of scoped attributes (which are implementation defined) are generally
hidden behind a portability macro that includes the surrounding
brackets.</p>
<h3 id="noexcept">noexcept</h3>
<p>Use of <code>noexcept</code> exception specifications (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n3050">n3050</a>) are permitted with restrictions
described below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Only the argument-less form of <code>noexcept</code> exception
specifications are permitted.</li>
<li>Allocation functions that may return <code>nullptr</code> to
indicate allocation failure must be declared <code>noexcept</code>.</li>
<li>All other uses of <code>noexcept</code> exception specifications are
forbidden.</li>
<li><code>noexcept</code> expressions are forbidden.</li>
<li>Dynamic exception specifications are forbidden.</li>
</ul>
<p>HotSpot is built with exceptions disabled, e.g. compile with
<code>-fno-exceptions</code> (gcc, clang) or no <code>/EH</code> option
(MSVC++). So why do we need to consider <code>noexcept</code> at all?
It's because <code>noexcept</code> exception specifications serve two
distinct purposes.</p>
<p>The first is to allow the compiler to avoid generating code or data
in support of exceptions being thrown by a function. But this is
unnecessary, because exceptions are disabled.</p>
<p>The second is to allow the compiler and library code to choose
different algorithms, depending on whether some function may throw
exceptions. This is only relevant to a certain set of functions.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Some allocation functions (<code>operator new</code> and
<code>operator new[]</code>) return <code>nullptr</code> to indicate
allocation failure. If a <code>new</code> expression calls such an
allocation function, it must check for and handle that possibility.
Declaring such a function <code>noexcept</code> informs the compiler
that <code>nullptr</code> is a possible result. If an allocation
function is not declared <code>noexcept</code> then the compiler may
elide that checking and handling for a <code>new</code> expression
calling that function.</p></li>
<li><p>Certain Standard Library facilities (notably containers) provide
different guarantees for some operations (and may choose different
algorithms to implement those operations), depending on whether certain
functions (constructors, copy/move operations, swap) are nothrow or not.
They detect this using type traits that test whether a function is
declared <code>noexcept</code>. This can have a significant performance
impact if, for example, copying is chosen over a potentially throwing
move. But this isn't relevant, since HotSpot forbids the use of most
Standard Library facilities.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>HotSpot code can assume no exceptions will ever be thrown, even from
functions not declared <code>noexcept</code>. So HotSpot code doesn't
ever need to check, either with conditional exception specifications or
with <code>noexcept</code> expressions.</p>
<p>The exception specification is part of the type of a function (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0012r1">p0012r1</a>. This likely has little
impact on HotSpot code, since the use of <code>noexcept</code> is
expected to be rare.</p>
<p>Dynamic exception specifications were deprecated in C++11. C++17
removed all but <code>throw()</code>, with that remaining a deprecated
equivalent to <code>noexcept</code>.</p>
<h3 id="enhanced-selection-statements">Enhanced selection
statements</h3>
<p>C++17 modified the <em>condition</em> part of <code>if</code> and
<code>switch</code> statements, permitting an <em>init-statement</em> to
be included (<a href="http://wg21.link/p0305r1">p0305r1</a>).</p>
<p>Use of this feature is permitted. (However, complex uses may
interfere with readability.) Limiting the scope of a variable involved
in the condition, while also making the value available to the
statement's body, can improve readability. The alternative method of
scope-limiting by introducing a nested scope isn't very popular and is
rarely used.</p>
<p>This new syntax is in addition to the <em>condition</em> being a
declaration with a <em>brace-or-equal-initializer</em>. For an
<code>if</code> statement this new sytax gains that benefit without
violating the long-standing guidance against using <a
href="#avoid-implicit-conversions-to-bool">implicit conversions to
<code>bool</code></a>, which still stands.</p>
<p>For example, uses of Unified Logging sometimes explicitly check
whether a <code>LogTarget</code> is enabled. Instead of</p>
<pre><code>  LogTarget(...) lt;
  if (lt.is_enabled()) {
    LogStream log(lt);
    ... use log ...
  }
  ... lt is accessible but probably not needed here ...</code></pre>
<p>using this feature one could write</p>
<pre><code>  if (LogTarget(...) lt; lt.is_enabled()) {
    LogStream log(lt);
    ... use log ...
  }</code></pre>
<p>C++17 also added compile-time <code>if</code> statements (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0292r2">p0292r2</a>). Use of
<code>if constexpr</code> is permitted. This feature can replace and
(sometimes vastly) simplify many uses of <a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/sfinae"
title="Substitution Failure Is Not An Error">SFINAE</a>. The same
declaration and initialization guidance for the <em>condition</em> part
apply here as for ordinary <code>if</code> statements.</p>
<h3 id="expression-evaluation-order">Expression Evaluation Order</h3>
<p>C++17 tightened up the evaluation order for some kinds of
subexpressions (<a href="http://wg21.link/p0138r2">p0138r2</a>). Note,
however, that the Alternate Evaluation Order for Function Calls
alternative in that paper was adopted, rather than the strict left to
right order of evaluation for function call arguments that was proposed
in the main body of the paper.</p>
<p>The primary purpose of this change seems to be to make certain kinds
of call chaining well defined. That's not a style widely used in
HotSpot. In general it is better to continue to avoid questions in this
area by isolating operations with side effects from other statements. In
particular, continue to avoid modifying a value in an expression where
it is also used.</p>
<h3 id="compatibility-with-c11">Compatibility with C11</h3>
<p>C++17 refers to C11 rather than C99. This means that C11 libraries
and functions may be used in HotSpot. There may be limitations because
of differing levels of compatibility among various compilers and
versions of those compilers.</p>
<p>Note that the C parts of the JDK have been built with C11 selected
for some time (<a
href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8292008">JDK-8292008</a>).</p>

<h2 id="forbidden-features">Forbidden Features</h2>
<h3 id="structured-bindings">Structured Bindings</h3>
<p>The use of structured bindings <a
href="http://wg21.link/p0217r3">p0217r3</a> is forbidden. Preferred
approaches for handling functions with multiple return values
include</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Return a named class/struct intended for that purpose, with named
and typed members/accessors.</p></li>
<li><p>Return a value along with out parameters (usually pointers,
sometimes references).</p></li>
<li><p>Designate a sentinel "failure" value in the normal return value
type, with some out of band location for additional information. For
example, this is the model typically used with <code>errno</code>, where
a function returns a normal result, or -1 to indicate an error, with
additional error information in <code>errno</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There is a strong preference for names and explicit types, as opposed
to offsets and implicit types. For example, there are folks who strongly
dislike that some of the Standard Library functions return
<code>std::pair</code> because <code>first</code> and
<code>second</code> members don't carry any useful information.</p>
<h3 id="file-system-library">File System Library</h3>
<p>The use of the File System library is forbidden. HotSpot doesn't do
very much with files, and already has adequate mechanisms for its needs.
Rewriting in terms of this new library doesn't provide any obviously
significant benefits. Having a mix of the existing usage and uses of
this new library would be confusing.</p>

<h3 id="aggregate-extensions">Aggregate Extensions</h3>
<p>Aggregates with base classes are forbidden. C++17 allows aggregate
initialization for classes with base classes (<a
href="https://wg21.link/p0017r1">p0017r1</a>). HotSpot makes very little
use of aggregate classes, preferring explicit constructors even for very
simple classes.</p>

<li><p>New string and character literals</p>
<ul>
<li>New character types (<a

<li>Unicode string literals (<a

<li>Raw string literals (<a

</ul>
<p>HotSpot doesn't need any of the new character and string literal
types.</p></li>
<li><p>User-defined literals (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2765.pdf">n2765</a>)
— User-defined literals should not be added casually, but only through a
proposal to add a specific UDL.</p></li>
<li><p>Inline namespaces (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2008/n2535.htm">n2535</a>)
— HotSpot makes very limited use of namespaces.</p></li>
<li><p><code>using namespace</code> directives. In particular, don't use
<code>using namespace std;</code> to avoid needing to qualify Standard
Library names.</p></li>
<li><p>Propagating exceptions (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2007/n2179.html">n2179</a>)
— HotSpot does not permit the use of exceptions, so this feature isn't
useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid most operator overloading, preferring named functions. When
operator overloading is used, ensure the semantics conform to the normal
expected behavior of the operation.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid most implicit conversion constructors and (implicit or
explicit) conversion operators. Conversion to <code>bool</code>
operators aren't needed because of the <a
href="#avoid-implicit-conversions-to-bool">no implicit boolean</a>
guideline.)</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid <code>goto</code> statements.</p></li>
<li><p>Attributes for namespaces and enumerators (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n4266">n4266</a> — The only applicable attribute
is <a href="#attributes"><code>[[deprecated]]</code></a>, which is
forbidden.</p></li>
<li><p>Variadic <code>using</code> declarations (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0195r2">p0195r2</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::variant&lt;&gt;</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0088r3">p0088r3</a>) — Even if more of the C++
Standard Library is permitted, this class will remain forbidded. Invalid
accesses are indicated by throwing exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::any</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0220r1">p0220r1</a>) — Even if more of the C++
Standard Library is permitted, this class will remain forbidden. It may
require allocation, and always uses the standard allocator. It requires
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-time_type_information"
title="Runtime Type Information">RTTI</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::as_const()</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0007r1">p0007r1</a>) — If sufficiently useful,
HotSpot could add such a function. It would likely be added to
globalDefinitions.hpp, where there are already some similar small
utilities.</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::clamp()</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p002501">p002501</a>) — This function is already
provided in globalDefinitions.hpp.</p></li>
<li><p>Parallel STL Algorithms (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0024r2">p0024r2</a>) — Even if more of the C++
Standard Library is permitted, these will remain forbidden. They are
built on the standard C++ threading mechanisms. HotSpot doesn't use
those mechanisms, instead providing and using its own.</p></li>
<li><p>Cache Line Sizes <a href="http://wg21.link/p0154r1">p0154r1</a> —
HotSpot has its own mechanisms for this, using values like
<code>DEFAULT_CACHE_LINE_SIZE</code>. The platform-specific
implementation of the HotSpot mechanisms might use these library
functions, but there is no reason to move away from the current
approach. Quoting from <a href="https://www.cppstd17.com"
title="C++17: The Complete Guide">JOSUTTIS</a>: "... if you know better,
use specific values, but using these values is better than any assumed
fixed size for code supporting multiple platforms."</p></li>
<li><p><code>register</code> storage class removal <a
href="http://wg21.link/p0001r1">p0001r1</a> — The <code>register</code>
storage class has been removed. <code>register</code> is still a
keyword, so still can't be used for normal purposes. Also, this doesn't
affect the use of <code>register</code> for gcc-style extended asm code;
that's a different syntactic element with a different meaning.</p></li>
<li><p>Value of <code>__cplusplus</code> — Testing whether
<code>__cplusplus</code> is defined or not is permitted, and indeed
required. But the value should not need to be examined. The value is
changed with each revision of the Standard. But we build HotSpot and
(most of) the rest of the JDK with a specifically selected version of
the Standard. The value of <code>__cplusplus</code> should be known and
unchanging until we change the project's build configuration again. So
examining the value shouldn't ever be necessary.</p></li>
<li><p>Removal of <code>++</code> for <code>bool</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0003r1">p0003r1</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Removal of trigraphs (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n4086">n4086</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="undecided-features">Undecided Features</h2>
<p>This list is incomplete; it serves to explicitly call out some
features that have not yet been discussed.</p>
<p>Some features are undecided (so implicitly forbidden) because we
don't expect to use them at all. This might be reconsidered if someone
finds a good use case.</p>
<p>Some Standard Library features are undecided (so implicitly
forbidden) because, while this Style Guide forbids the use of such, they
may be sufficiently useful that we want to permit them anyway. Doing so
may require some idiomatic mechanism for addressing things like
<code>assert</code> incompatibility, incompatibility with HotSpot's
<code>FORBID_C_FUNCTION</code> mechanism, and the like.</p>
<h3 id="stdoptional">std::optional&lt;&gt;</h3>
<p>It is undecided whether to permit the use of
<code>std::optional&lt;&gt;</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0220r1">p0220r1</a>). It may be sufficiently
useful that it should be permitted despite the usual prohibition against
using Standard Library facilities. Use of the <code>value()</code>
member function must be forbidden, as it reports an invalid access by
throwing an exception.</p>
<h3 id="stdbyte">std::byte</h3>
<p>It is undecided whether to permit the use of the
<code>std::byte</code> type (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0298r3">p0298r3</a>). It may be sufficiently
useful that it should be permitted despite the usual prohibition against
using Standard Library facilities.</p>
<p>It has been suggested that changing the HotSpot <code>address</code>
type to use <code>std::byte</code> has some benefits. That is,
replace</p>
<pre><code>typedef u_char*       address;
typedef const u_char* const_address;</code></pre>
<pre><code>using address       = std::byte*;
using const_address = const std::byte*;</code></pre>
<p>in globalDefinitions.hpp.</p>
<p>A specific benefit that was mentioned is that it might improve the
horrible way that gdb handles our current definition of the
<code>address</code> type.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;cstddef&gt;

typedef unsigned char* address;
typedef std::byte* address_b;

int main() {

  char* mem;

  address addr = (address)mem;
  address_b addr_b = (address_b)mem;

  return 0;
}</code></pre>
<pre><code>(gdb) p addr
$1 = (address) 0x7ffff7fe4fa0 &lt;dl_main&gt; &quot;\363\017\036\372Uf\017\357\300H\211\345AWI\211\377AVAUATSH\201\354\210\002&quot;
(gdb) p addr_b
$2 = (address_b) 0x7ffff7fe4fa0 &lt;dl_main&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This needs to be explored. Some folks have said they will do so.</p>
<h3 id="string-views">String Views</h3>
<p>It is undecided whether to permit the use of
<code>std::string_view</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0220r1">p0220r1</a>).</p>
<p>HotSpot doesn't use <code>std::string</code>, but uses
<code>char*</code> strings a lot. Wrapping such in a
<code>std::string_view</code> to enable the use of various algorithms
could be useful. But since HotSpot also doesn't permit use of
<code>&lt;algorithm&gt;</code> and the like, that only gets the limited
set of algorithms provided by the view class directly.</p>
<p>There is also the issue of <code>NUL</code> termination; string views
are not necessarily <code>NUL</code> terminated. Moreover, if one goes
to the work of making one that is <code>NUL</code> terminated, that
terminator is included in the size.</p>
<p>There are other caveats. Permitting use of string views would require
discussion of those.</p>
<h3 id="substring-and-subsequence-searching">Substring and Subsequence
Searching</h3>
<p>In addition to simple substring searching, the Standard Library now
includes Boyer-Moore and Boyer-Moore-Horspool searchers, in case someone
wants to search really large texts. That seems an unlikely use-case for
HotSpot. See <a href="http://wg21.link/p0220r1">p0220r1</a>.</p>
<h3 id="new-and-delete-with-over-aligned-data"><code>new</code> and
<code>delete</code> with Over-Aligned Data</h3>
<p>It is undecided whether to permit the use of dynamic allocation of
overaligned types (<a href="http://wg21.link/n3396">n3396</a>).</p>
<p>HotSpot currently only has a couple of over-aligned types that are
dynamically allocated. These are handled manually, not going through
<code>new</code> expressions, as that couldn't work before C++17.</p>
<p>One of the ways an over-aligned type might arise is by aligning a
data member. This might be done to avoid destructive interference for
concurrent accesses. But HotSpot uses a different approach, using
explicit padding. Again, this is in part because <code>new</code> and
<code>delete</code> of overaligned types didn't work. But we might
prefer to continue this approach.</p>
<p>We would need to add <code>operator new</code> overloads to
<code>CHeapObj&lt;&gt;</code> and possibly in other places in order to
support this. However, it has been suggested that implementing it
(efficiently) on top of NMT might be difficult. Note that
<code>posix_memalign</code> / <code>_aligned_malloc</code> don't help
here, because of NMT's use of malloc headers.</p>
<p>If we don't support it we may want to add <code>operator new</code>
overloads that are deleted, to prevent attempted uses.</p>
<p>Alignment usage in non-HotSpot parts of the OpenJDK:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><code>alignas</code> used once in harfbuzz, to align a
variable.</p></li>
<li><p>libpipewire has <code>#define SPA_ALIGNED</code> macro using gcc
<code>aligned</code> attribute, but doesn't use it.</p></li>
<li><p>libsleef has <code>#define ALIGNED</code> macro using gcc
<code>aligned</code> attribute. It is not used for class or member
declarations.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="stdto_chars-and-stdfrom_chars"><code>std::to_chars()</code> and
<code>std::from_chars</code></h3>
<p>It is undecided whether to permit the use of
<code>std::to_chars()</code> and <code>std::from_chars()</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0067r5">p0067r5</a>).</p>
<p>These functions provide low-level conversions between character
sequences and numeric values. This seems like a good candidate for use
in HotSpot, potentially replacing various clumsy or less performant
alternatives. There is no memory allocation. Parsing failures are
indicated via error codes rather than exceptions. Various other nice for
HotSpot properties.</p>
<p>Note that the published C++17 Standard puts these in
<code>&lt;utility&gt;</code>, but a defect report moved them to
<code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code>. This also needs
<code>&lt;system_error&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This would require upgrading the minimum gcc version to 11.1 for
floating point conversion support. The minimum Visual Studio version is
already sufficient. The minimum clang version requirement hasn't been
determined yet.</p>
<h3 id="stdlaunder"><code>std::launder()</code></h3>
<p>It is undecided whether to permit the use of
<code>std::launder()</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/p0137r1">p0137r1</a>).</p>
<p>Change to permitted if we discover a place where we need it. Or maybe
we should just permit it, but hope we don't need it.</p>
<p>Also, C++20 revised the relevant part of Object Lifetime in a way
that seems more permissive and with less need of laundering. We don't
know if implementations of prior versions take advantage of the
difference.</p>

<h3 id="additional-undecided-features">Additional Undecided
Features</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Member initializers and aggregates (<a
href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2013/n3653.html">n3653</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Rvalue references and move semantics</p></li>
<li><p>Shorthand for nested namespaces (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n4230">n4230</a>) — HotSpot makes very little use
of namespaces, so this seemingly innocuous feature probably isn't useful
to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Direct list initialization with <code>auto</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n3681">n3681</a>) — This change fixed some issues
with direct list initialization and <code>auto</code>. But we don't use
that feature much, if at all. And perhaps shouldn't be using
it.</p></li>
<li><p>UTF-8 Character Literals (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n4267">n4267</a>) — Do we have a use-case for
this?</p></li>
<li><p>Fold Expressions (<a href="http://wg21.link/n4295">n4295</a>) —
Provides a simple way to apply operators to a parameter pack. HotSpot
doesn't use variadic templates very much. That makes it questionable
that developers should need to know about this feature. But if someone
does come up with a good use-case, it's likely that the alternatives are
significantly worse, because pack manipulation without this can be
complicated.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/tuple.html"><code>&lt;tuple&gt;</code></a>
— Prefer named access to class objects, rather than indexed access to
anonymous heterogeneous sequences. In particular, a standard-layout
class is preferred to a tuple.</p></li>
<li><p><code>std::invoke&lt;&gt;()</code> (<a
href="http://wg21.link/n4169">n4169</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/chrono.html"><code>&lt;chrono&gt;</code></a>
— The argument for chrono is that our existing APIs aren't serving us
well. chrono provides strong type safety. We've had multiple cases of
mistakes like a double seconds being treated as double milliseconds or
vice versa, and other similar errors. But it would be a large effort to
adopt chrono. We'd also need to decide whether to use the predefined
clocks or hook up chrono to our clocks. It may be that using the
predefined clocks is fine, but it's a question that needs careful
study.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/initializer_list.html"><code>&lt;initializer_list&gt;</code></a>
— The potential ambiguity between some forms of direct initialization
and initializer list initialization, and the resolution of that
ambiguity, is unfortunate.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/ratio.html"><code>&lt;ratio&gt;</code></a>
— <code>&lt;ratio&gt;</code> is a <em>compile-time</em> rational
arithmetic package. It's also fixed (though parameterized) precision.
It's not a general purpose rational arithmetic facility. It appears to
have started out as an implementation detail of chrono, and was
extracted and promoted to a public facility in the belief that it has
broader utility.</p></li>
<li><p><a
href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/system_error.html"><code>&lt;system_error&gt;</code></a>
— We don't really have a generally agreed upon mechanism for managing
errors. Instead, we have a plethora of bespoke ad hoc mechanisms.
Managing errors is a topic of substantial discussion.
<code>&lt;system_error&gt;</code> might end up being a part of a result
from that discussion.</p></li>
