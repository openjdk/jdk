control what you are doing, like:  /list\n\
\n\
For a list of commands: /help

help.shortcuts.summary = a description of shortcuts
help.shortcuts =\
Supported shortcuts include:\n\
\n\
<tab>\n\t\t\
        After entering the first few letters of a Java identifier,\n\t\t\
        a jshell command, or, in some cases, a jshell command argument,\n\t\t\
        press the <tab> key to complete the input.\n\t\t\
        If there is more than one completion, show possible completions.\n\n\
Shift-<tab>\n\t\t\
        After the name and open parenthesis of a method or constructor invocation,\n\t\t\
        hold the <shift> key and press the <tab> to see a synopsis of all\n\t\t\
        matching methods/constructors.\n\n\
<fix-shortcut> v\n\t\t\
        After a complete expression, press "<fix-shortcut> v" to introduce a new variable\n\t\t\
        whose type is based on the type of the expression.\n\t\t\
        The "<fix-shortcut>" is either Alt-F1 or Alt-Enter, depending on the platform.\n\n\
<fix-shortcut> i\n\t\t\
        After an unresolvable identifier, press "<fix-shortcut> i" and jshell will propose\n\t\t\
        possible fully qualified names based on the content of the specified classpath.\n\t\t\
        The "<fix-shortcut>" is either Alt-F1 or Alt-Enter, depending on the platform.

help.set.format = \
Set the format for reporting a snippet event.\n\
\n\t\
/set format <mode> <field> "<format>" <selector>...\n\
\n\
Where <mode> is the name of a previously defined feedback mode -- see '/help /set newmode'.\n\
Where <field> is the name of context-specific format to define.\n\
Where <format> is a quoted string which will be the value of the field if one of\n\
the selectors matches (or there are no selectors). When the format is used,\n\
field names enclosed in braces are replaced with the value of the field at that\n\
time. These fields may have been previously defined with this command or may be\n\
one of these predefined fields specific to the context:\n\t\
{name}       == The name, e.g.: the variable name, ...\n\t\
{type}       == The type name. The type of a variable or expression, the\n\t\t\t\
                 parameter types of a method\n\t\
{value}      == The result value of an expression or variable initialization\n\t\
{unresolved} == The list of unresolved references\n\t\
{errors}     == The list of recoverable errors (during the processing of the\n\t\t\t\
                "display" field only)\n\t\
{err}        == An unformatted error line (during the processing of the\n\t\t\t\
                "errorline" field only)\n\
The following fields are accessed by the tool to determine the displayed feedback:\n\t\
{display}    == The displayed message for a snippet event\n\t\
{errorline}  == The format of one error line within the "errors" field\n\t\
{pre}        == The feedback prefix (begins command feedback)\n\t\
{post}       == The feedback postfix (ends command feedback)\n\t\
{errorpre}   == The error prefix (begins error feedback)\n\t\
{errorpost}  == The error postfix (ends error feedback)\n\
These fields have default settings (which may be overwritten).\n\
Where <selector> is the context in which the format is applied.\n\
The structure of selector is a hyphen separated list of selector kind lists.\n\
A selector kind list is a comma separated list of values of one selector kind.\n\
A selector matches if each selector kind list matches; A selector kind list\n\
matches if one of the values matches.\n\n\
The case selector kind describes the kind of snippet.  The values are:\n\t\
   import     -- import declaration\n\t\
   class      -- class declaration\n\t\
   interface  -- interface declaration\n\t\
   enum       -- enum declaration\n\t\
   annotation -- annotation interface declaration\n\t\
   method     -- method declaration -- note: {type}==parameter-types\n\t\
   vardecl    -- variable declaration without init\n\t\
   varinit    -- variable declaration with init\n\t\
   expression -- expression -- note: {name}==scratch-variable-name\n\t\
   varvalue   -- variable value expression\n\t\
   assignment -- assign variable\n\t\
   statement  -- statement\n\
The action selector kind describes what happened to the snippet.  The values are:\n\t\
   added     -- snippet has been added\n\t\
   modified  -- an existing snippet has been modified\n\t\
   replaced  -- an existing snippet has been replaced with a new snippet\n\t\
   overwrote -- an existing snippet has been overwritten\n\t\
   dropped   -- snippet has been dropped\n\t\
   used      -- snippet was used when it cannot be\n\
The when-did-it-occur selector kind describes if this is a direct or indirect action.  The values are:\n\t\
   primary -- the entered snippet\n\t\
   update  -- an update to a dependent snippet\n\
The resolution-state selector kind describes the state of resolution/definition of the snippet.  The values are:\n\t\
   ok         -- resolved correctly\n\t\
   defined    -- defined despite recoverably unresolved references\n\t\
   notdefined -- not defined because of recoverably unresolved references\n\
The unresolved-count selector kind describes the number of unresolved references.  The values are:\n\t\
   unresolved0 -- no names are unresolved\n\t\
   unresolved1 -- one name is unresolved\n\t\
   unresolved2 -- two or more names are unresolved\n\
The errors-count selector kind describes the number of errors.  The values are:\n\t\
   error0 -- no errors\n\t\
   error1 -- one error\n\t\
   error2 -- two or more errors\n\n\
Examples:\n\t\
/set format myformat action 'Created' added-primary\n\t\
/set format myformat action 'Update replaced' replaced-update\n\t\
/set format myformat display '{pre}{action} class {name}{post}' class-ok\n\t\
/set format myformat display '{pre}{action} variable {name}, reset to null{post}' replaced-vardecl,varinit-ok-update\n\n\
Note that subsequent selectors for a field may overwrite some or all of previous used selectors -- last one wins\n

help.set.feedback = \
Set the feedback mode describing displayed feedback for entered snippets and commands.\n\
\n\t\
/set feedback <mode>\n\
\n\
Where <mode> is the name of a previously defined feedback mode.\n\
You may use just enough letters to make it unique.\n\
User-defined modes can be added, see '/help /set newmode'\n\
Currently defined feedback modes:\n

help.set.newmode = \
Create a user-defined feedback mode, optionally copying from an existing mode.\n\
\n\t\
/set newmode <new-mode> [command|quiet [<old-mode>]]\n\
\n\
Where <new-mode> is the name of a mode you wish to create.\n\
Where <old-mode> is the name of a previously defined feedback mode.\n\
If <old-mode> is present, its settings are copied to the new mode.\n\
'command' vs 'quiet' determines if informative/verifying command feedback is displayed.\n\
\n\
Once the new mode is created, use '/set format' and '/set prompt' to configure it.\n\
Use '/set feedback' to use the new mode.\n\

help.set.prompt = \
Set the prompts.  Both the normal prompt and the continuation-prompt must be set.\n\
\n\t\
/set prompt <mode> \"<prompt>\" \"<continuation-prompt>\"\n\
\n\
Where <mode> is the name of a previously defined feedback mode.\n\
Where <prompt> and <continuation-prompt> are quoted strings printed as input prompts;\n\
Both may optionally contain '%s' which will be substituted with the next snippet id --\n\
note that what is entered may not be assigned that id, for example it may be an error or command.\n\
The continuation-prompt is used on the second and subsequent lines of a multi-line snippet.\n

help.set.editor =\
Specify the command to launch for the /edit command.\n\
\n\t\
/set editor <command> <optional-arg>...\n\
\n\
The <command> is an operating system dependent string.\n\
The <command> may include space-separated arguments (such as flags) -- <optional-arg>....\n\
When /edit is used, the temporary file to edit will be appended as the last argument.

help.set.start =\
Set the start-up configuration -- a sequence of snippets and commands read at start-up.\n\
\n\t\
/set start <file>\n\
\n\
The contents of the specified <file> become the default start-up snippets and commands --\n\
which are run when the jshell tool is started or reset.
