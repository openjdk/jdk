## miscellaneous strings
##

apt.misc.Deprecation=\
    \nwarning:\u0020The apt tool and its associated API are planned to be\n\

    javax.annotation.processing and javax.lang.model.  Users are\n\
    recommended to migrate to the annotation processing features of\n\
    javac; see the javac man page for more information.\n

apt.misc.Problem=\
    Problem encountered during annotation processing; \nsee stacktrace below for more information.

apt.misc.SunMiscService=\
