/**
 * A simple visitor for annotation values with default behavior
 * appropriate for the {@link SourceVersion#RELEASE_7 RELEASE_7}
 * source version.  Visit methods call {@link
 * #defaultAction} passing their arguments to {@code defaultAction}'s
 * corresponding parameters.
 *
 * <p> Methods in this class may be overridden subject to their
 * general contract.  Note that annotating methods in concrete
 * subclasses with {@link java.lang.Override @Override} will help
 * ensure that methods are overridden as intended.
 *
 * <p> <b>WARNING:</b> The {@code AnnotationValueVisitor} interface
 * implemented by this class may have methods added to it in the
 * future to accommodate new, currently unknown, language structures
 * added to future versions of the Java&trade; programming language.
 * Therefore, methods whose names begin with {@code "visit"} may be
 * added to this class in the future; to avoid incompatibilities,
 * classes which extend this class should not declare any instance
 * methods with names beginning with {@code "visit"}.
 *
 * <p>When such a new visit method is added, the default
 * implementation in this class will be to call the {@link
 * #visitUnknown visitUnknown} method.  A new simple annotation
 * value visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the
 * new language level; this visitor will have different default
 * behavior for the visit method in question.  When the new visitor is
 * introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.
 *
 * @param <R> the return type of this visitor's methods
 * @param <P> the type of the additional parameter to this visitor's methods.
 *
 * @see SimpleAnnotationValueVisitor6
 * @since 1.7
