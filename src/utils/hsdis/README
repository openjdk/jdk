'hsdis': A HotSpot plugin for disassembling dynamically generated code.

The files in this directory are built independently of the HotSpot JVM.

* Building

To build this project you need a copy of GNU binutils to build against. It is
known to work with binutils 2.37. Building against versions older than 2.29 is
not supported. Download a copy of the software from
http://directory.fsf.org/project/binutils or one of its mirrors.

To build this library, you must enable building in configure by "bash configure
--with-hsdis=binutils".

You must also specify where binutils is located. To facilitate building, you can
point to a place where the (unpacked) binutils sources are located using
"--with-binutils-src=<location>", and configure will build binutils for you. On
repeated runs, you can keep this command line option, since configure will
figure out that the binutils binaries are already present and skip building, or
you can replace it with "--with-binutils=<location>".

If you have pre-built binutils binaries, you can point to them directly using
"--with-binutils=<location>".

When you have created a proper configuration, you can then build the hsdis
library using "make build-hsdis".

* Building on Windows

On Windows, the normal Microsoft Visual Studio toolchain cannot build binutils.
Instead we need to use the mingw compiler. This is available as a cygwin
package. You need to install the "gcc-core" and "mingw64-x86_64-gcc-core"
packages (or "mingw64-i686-gcc-core", if you want the 32-bit version) and
"mingw64-x86_64-glib2.0".

* Installing

To build the hsdis library, run "make build-hsdis". This will build the library
in a separate directory, but not make it available to the JDK in the
configuration. To actually install it in the JDK, run "make install-hsdis".

Note: The resulting build may not be distributable. Please get legal advice if
you intend to distribute the result of your build.

* Using the library

The hsdis library will be automatically loaded by Hotspot when you use the
diagnostic option "-XX:+PrintAssembly". Note that since this is a diagnostic
option, you need to unlock these first, so in practice you activate it using
"-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintAssembly".

More information is available at the wiki
[https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/HotSpot/PrintAssembly].
