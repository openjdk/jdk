.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] tool has two purposes:
.IP \[bu] 2
To sign Java Archive (JAR) files.
.IP \[bu] 2
To verify the signatures and integrity of signed JAR files.
.PP
The JAR feature enables the packaging of class files, images, sounds,
and other digital data in a single file for faster and easier
distribution.
A tool named \f[V]jar\f[R] enables developers to produce JAR files.
(Technically, any ZIP file can also be considered a JAR file, although
when created by the \f[V]jar\f[R] command or processed by the
\f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command, JAR files also contain a
\f[V]META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\f[R] file.)
.PP
A digital signature is a string of bits that is computed from some data
(the data being signed) and the private key of an entity (a person,
company, and so on).
Similar to a handwritten signature, a digital signature has many useful
characteristics:
.IP \[bu] 2
Its authenticity can be verified by a computation that uses the public
key corresponding to the private key used to generate the signature.
.IP \[bu] 2
It can\[aq]t be forged, assuming the private key is kept secret.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is a function of the data signed and thus can\[aq]t be claimed to be
the signature for other data as well.
.IP \[bu] 2
The signed data can\[aq]t be changed.
If the data is changed, then the signature can\[aq]t be verified as
authentic.
.PP
To generate an entity\[aq]s signature for a file, the entity must first
have a public/private key pair associated with it and one or more
certificates that authenticate its public key.
A certificate is a digitally signed statement from one entity that says
that the public key of another entity has a particular value.
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command uses key and certificate information
from a keystore to generate digital signatures for JAR files.
A keystore is a database of private keys and their associated X.509
certificate chains that authenticate the corresponding public keys.
The \f[V]keytool\f[R] command is used to create and administer
keystores.
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command uses an entity\[aq]s private key to
generate a signature.
The signed JAR file contains, among other things, a copy of the
certificate from the keystore for the public key corresponding to the
private key used to sign the file.
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command can verify the digital signature of the
signed JAR file using the certificate inside it (in its signature block
file).
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command can generate signatures that include a
time stamp that enables a systems or deployer to check whether the JAR
file was signed while the signing certificate was still valid.
.PP
In addition, APIs allow applications to obtain the timestamp
information.
.PP
At this time, the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command can only sign JAR files
created by the \f[V]jar\f[R] command or zip files.
JAR files are the same as zip files, except they also have a
\f[V]META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\f[R] file.
A \f[V]META-INF/MANIFEST.MF\f[R] file is created when the
\f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command signs a zip file.
.PP
The default \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command behavior is to sign a JAR or zip
file.
Use the \f[V]-verify\f[R] option to verify a signed JAR file.
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command also attempts to validate the
signer\[aq]s certificate after signing or verifying.
During validation, it checks the revocation status of each certificate
in the signer\[aq]s certificate chain when the \f[V]-revCheck\f[R]
option is specified.
If there is a validation error or any other problem, the command
generates warning messages.
If you specify the \f[V]-strict\f[R] option, then the command treats
severe warnings as errors.
See \f[B]Errors and Warnings\f[R].
.SH KEYSTORE ALIASES
.PP
All keystore entities are accessed with unique aliases.
.PP
When you use the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command to sign a JAR file, you
must specify the alias for the keystore entry that contains the private
key needed to generate the signature.
If no output file is specified, it overwrites the original JAR file with
the signed JAR file.
.PP
Keystores are protected with a password, so the store password must be
specified.
You are prompted for it when you don\[aq]t specify it on the command
line.
Similarly, private keys are protected in a keystore with a password, so
the private key\[aq]s password must be specified, and you are prompted
for the password when you don\[aq]t specify it on the command line and
it isn\[aq]t the same as the store password.
.SH KEYSTORE LOCATION
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command has a \f[V]-keystore\f[R] option for
specifying the URL of the keystore to be used.
The keystore is by default stored in a file named \f[V].keystore\f[R] in
the user\[aq]s home directory, as determined by the \f[V]user.home\f[R]
system property.
.PP
\f[B]Linux and macOS:\f[R] \f[V]user.home\f[R] defaults to the
user\[aq]s home directory.
.PP
The input stream from the \f[V]-keystore\f[R] option is passed to the
\f[V]KeyStore.load\f[R] method.
If \f[V]NONE\f[R] is specified as the URL, then a null stream is passed
to the \f[V]KeyStore.load\f[R] method.
\f[V]NONE\f[R] should be specified when the \f[V]KeyStore\f[R] class
isn\[aq]t file based, for example, when it resides on a hardware token
device.
.SH KEYSTORE IMPLEMENTATION
.PP
The \f[V]KeyStore\f[R] class provided in the \f[V]java.security\f[R]
package supplies a number of well-defined interfaces to access and
modify the information in a keystore.
You can have multiple different concrete implementations, where each
implementation is for a particular type of keystore.
.PP
Currently, there are two command-line tools that use keystore
implementations (\f[V]keytool\f[R] and \f[V]jarsigner\f[R]).
.PP
The default keystore implementation is \f[V]PKCS12\f[R].
This is a cross platform keystore based on the RSA PKCS12 Personal
Information Exchange Syntax Standard.
This standard is primarily meant for storing or transporting a
user\[aq]s private keys, certificates, and miscellaneous secrets.
There is another built-in implementation, provided by Oracle.
It implements the keystore as a file with a proprietary keystore type
(format) named \f[V]JKS\f[R].
It protects each private key with its individual password, and also
protects the integrity of the entire keystore with a (possibly
different) password.
.PP
Keystore implementations are provider-based, which means the application
interfaces supplied by the \f[V]KeyStore\f[R] class are implemented in
terms of a Service Provider Interface (SPI).
There is a corresponding abstract \f[V]KeystoreSpi\f[R] class, also in
the \f[V]java.security package\f[R], that defines the Service Provider
Interface methods that providers must implement.
The term provider refers to a package or a set of packages that supply a
concrete implementation of a subset of services that can be accessed by
the Java Security API.
To provide a keystore implementation, clients must implement a provider
and supply a \f[V]KeystoreSpi\f[R] subclass implementation, as described
in \f[B]How to Implement a Provider in the Java Cryptography
Architecture\f[R]
[https://www.oracle.com/pls/topic/lookup?ctx=en/java/javase&id=security_guide_implement_provider_jca].
.PP
Applications can choose different types of keystore implementations from
different providers, with the \f[V]getInstance\f[R] factory method in
the \f[V]KeyStore\f[R] class.
A keystore type defines the storage and data format of the keystore
information and the algorithms used to protect private keys in the
keystore and the integrity of the keystore itself.
Keystore implementations of different types aren\[aq]t compatible.
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] commands can read file-based keystores from any
location that can be specified using a URL.
In addition, these commands can read non-file-based keystores such as
those provided by MSCAPI on Windows and PKCS11 on all platforms.
.PP
For the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] and \f[V]keytool\f[R] commands, you can
specify a keystore type at the command line with the
\f[V]-storetype\f[R] option.
.PP
If you don\[aq]t explicitly specify a keystore type, then the tools
choose a keystore implementation based on the value of the
\f[V]keystore.type\f[R] property specified in the security properties
file.
The security properties file is called \f[V]java.security\f[R], and it
resides in the JDK security properties directory,
\f[V]java.home/conf/security\f[R].
.PP
Each tool gets the \f[V]keystore.type\f[R] value and then examines all
the installed providers until it finds one that implements keystores of
that type.
It then uses the keystore implementation from that provider.
.PP
The \f[V]KeyStore\f[R] class defines a static method named
\f[V]getDefaultType\f[R] that lets applications retrieve the value of
the \f[V]keystore.type\f[R] property.
The following line of code creates an instance of the default keystore
type as specified in the \f[V]keystore.type\f[R] property:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]KeyStore keyStore = KeyStore.getInstance(KeyStore.getDefaultType());\f[R]
.RE
.PP
The default keystore type is \f[V]pkcs12\f[R], which is a cross platform
keystore based on the RSA PKCS12 Personal Information Exchange Syntax
Standard.
This is specified by the following line in the security properties file:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]keystore.type=pkcs12\f[R]
.RE
.PP
Case doesn\[aq]t matter in keystore type designations.
For example, \f[V]JKS\f[R] is the same as \f[V]jks\f[R].
.PP
To have the tools utilize a keystore implementation other than the
default, you can change that line to specify a different keystore type.
For example, if you want to use the Oracle\[aq]s \f[V]jks\f[R] keystore
implementation, then change the line to the following:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]keystore.type=jks\f[R]
.RE
.SH SUPPORTED ALGORITHMS
.PP
By default, the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command signs a JAR file using one
of the following algorithms and block file extensions depending on the
type and size of the private key:

.TE
.IP \[bu] 2
If an RSASSA-PSS key is encoded with parameters, then jarsigner will use
the same parameters in the signature.
Otherwise, jarsigner will use parameters that are determined by the size
of the key as specified in the table above.
For example, an 3072-bit RSASSA-PSS key will use RSASSA-PSS as the
signature algorithm and SHA-384 as the hash and MGF1 algorithms.
.IP \[bu] 2
If a key algorithm is not listed in this table, the \f[V].DSA\f[R]
extension is used when signing a JAR file.
.PP
These default signature algorithms can be overridden by using the
\f[V]-sigalg\f[R] option.
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command uses the
\f[V]jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms\f[R] and
\f[V]jdk.security.legacyAlgorithms\f[R] security properties to determine
which algorithms are considered a security risk.
If the JAR file was signed with any algorithms that are disabled, it
will be treated as an unsigned JAR file.
If the JAR file was signed with any legacy algorithms, it will be
treated as signed with an informational warning to inform users that the
legacy algorithm will be disabled in a future update.
For detailed verification output, include
\f[V]-J-Djava.security.debug=jar\f[R].
The \f[V]jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms\f[R] and
\f[V]jdk.security.legacyAlgorithms\f[R] security properties are defined
in the \f[V]java.security\f[R] file (located in the JDK\[aq]s
\f[V]$JAVA_HOME/conf/security\f[R] directory).
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R]
.PP
In order to improve out of the box security, default key size and
signature algorithm names are periodically updated to stronger values
with each release of the JDK.
If interoperability with older releases of the JDK is important, please
make sure the defaults are supported by those releases, or alternatively
use the \f[V]-sigalg\f[R] option to override the default values at your
own risk.
.SH THE SIGNED JAR FILE
.PP
When the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command is used to sign a JAR file, the
output signed JAR file is exactly the same as the input JAR file, except
that it has two additional files placed in the META-INF directory:
.IP \[bu] 2
A signature file with an \f[V].SF\f[R] extension
.IP \[bu] 2
A signature block file with a \f[V].DSA\f[R], \f[V].RSA\f[R], or
\f[V].EC\f[R] extension
.PP
The base file names for these two files come from the value of the
\f[V]-sigfile\f[R] option.
For example, when the option is \f[V]-sigfile MKSIGN\f[R], the files are
named \f[V]MKSIGN.SF\f[R] and \f[V]MKSIGN.RSA\f[R].
In this document, we assume the signer always uses an RSA key.
.PP
If no \f[V]-sigfile\f[R] option appears on the command line, then the
base file name for the \f[V].SF\f[R] and the signature block files is
the first 8 characters of the alias name specified on the command line,
all converted to uppercase.
If the alias name has fewer than 8 characters, then the full alias name
is used.
If the alias name contains any characters that aren\[aq]t allowed in a
signature file name, then each such character is converted to an
underscore (_) character in forming the file name.
Valid characters include letters, digits, underscores, and hyphens.
.SH SIGNATURE FILE
.PP
A signature file (\f[V].SF\f[R] file) looks similar to the manifest file
that is always included in a JAR file when the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R]
command is used to sign the file.
For each source file included in the JAR file, the \f[V].SF\f[R] file
has two lines, such as in the manifest file, that list the following:
.IP \[bu] 2
File name
.IP \[bu] 2
Name of the digest algorithm (SHA)
.IP \[bu] 2
SHA digest value
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R]
.PP
The name of the digest algorithm (SHA) and the SHA digest value are on
the same line.
.PP
In the manifest file, the SHA digest value for each source file is the
digest (hash) of the binary data in the source file.
In the \f[V].SF\f[R] file, the digest value for a specified source file
is the hash of the two lines in the manifest file for the source file.
.PP
The signature file, by default, includes a header with a hash of the
whole manifest file.
The header also contains a hash of the manifest header.
The presence of the header enables verification optimization.
See \f[B]JAR File Verification\f[R].
.SH SIGNATURE BLOCK FILE
.PP
The \f[V].SF\f[R] file is signed and the signature is placed in the
signature block file.
This file also contains, encoded inside it, the certificate or
certificate chain from the keystore that authenticates the public key
corresponding to the private key used for signing.
The file has the extension \f[V].DSA\f[R], \f[V].RSA\f[R], or
\f[V].EC\f[R], depending on the key algorithm used.
See the table in \f[B]Supported Algorithms\f[R].
.SH SIGNATURE TIME STAMP
.PP
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command used with the following options
generates and stores a signature time stamp when signing a JAR file:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]-tsa\f[R] \f[I]url\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]-tsacert\f[R] \f[I]alias\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]-tsapolicyid\f[R] \f[I]policyid\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]-tsadigestalg\f[R] \f[I]algorithm\f[R]
.PP
See \f[B]Options for jarsigner\f[R].
.SH JAR FILE VERIFICATION
.PP
A successful JAR file verification occurs when the signatures are valid,
and none of the files that were in the JAR file when the signatures were
generated have changed since then.
JAR file verification involves the following steps:
.IP "1." 3
Verify the signature of the \f[V].SF\f[R] file.
.RS 4
.PP
The verification ensures that the signature stored in each signature
block file was generated using the private key corresponding to the
public key whose certificate (or certificate chain) also appears in the
signature block file.
It also ensures that the signature is a valid signature of the
corresponding signature (\f[V].SF\f[R]) file, and thus the \f[V].SF\f[R]
file wasn\[aq]t tampered with.
.RE
.IP "2." 3
Verify the digest listed in each entry in the \f[V].SF\f[R] file with
each corresponding section in the manifest.
.RS 4
.PP
The \f[V].SF\f[R] file by default includes a header that contains a hash
of the entire manifest file.
When the header is present, the verification can check to see whether or
not the hash in the header matches the hash of the manifest file.
If there is a match, then verification proceeds to the next step.
.PP
If there is no match, then a less optimized verification is required to
ensure that the hash in each source file information section in the
\f[V].SF\f[R] file equals the hash of its corresponding section in the
manifest file.
See Signature File.
.PP
One reason the hash of the manifest file that is stored in the
\f[V].SF\f[R] file header might not equal the hash of the current
manifest file is that it might contain sections for newly added files
after the file was signed.
For example, suppose one or more files were added to the signed JAR file
(using the \f[V]jar\f[R] tool) that already contains a signature and a
\f[V].SF\f[R] file.
If the JAR file is signed again by a different signer, then the manifest
file is changed (sections are added to it for the new files by the
\f[V]jarsigner\f[R] tool) and a new \f[V].SF\f[R] file is created, but
the original \f[V].SF\f[R] file is unchanged.
A verification is still considered successful if none of the files that
were in the JAR file when the original signature was generated have been
changed since then.
This is because the hashes in the non-header sections of the
\f[V].SF\f[R] file equal the hashes of the corresponding sections in the
manifest file.
.RE
.IP "3." 3
Read each file in the JAR file that has an entry in the \f[V].SF\f[R]
file.
While reading, compute the file\[aq]s digest and compare the result with
the digest for this file in the manifest section.
The digests should be the same or verification fails.
.RS 4
.PP
If any serious verification failures occur during the verification
process, then the process is stopped and a security exception is thrown.
The \f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command catches and displays the exception.
.RE
.IP "4." 3
Check for disabled algorithm usage.
See \f[B]Supported Algorithms\f[R].
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R]
.PP
You should read any addition warnings (or errors if you specified the
\f[V]-strict\f[R] option), as well as the content of the certificate (by
specifying the \f[V]-verbose\f[R] and \f[V]-certs\f[R] options) to
determine if the signature can be trusted.
.SH MULTIPLE SIGNATURES FOR A JAR FILE
.PP
A JAR file can be signed by multiple people by running the
\f[V]jarsigner\f[R] command on the file multiple times and specifying
the alias for a different person each time, as follows:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jarsigner myBundle.jar susan
jarsigner myBundle.jar kevin
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
When a JAR file is signed multiple times, there are multiple
\f[V].SF\f[R] and signature block files in the resulting JAR file, one
pair for each signature.
In the previous example, the output JAR file includes files with the
following names:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
SUSAN.SF
SUSAN.RSA
KEVIN.SF
KEVIN.RSA
\f[R]
.fi
.SH OPTIONS FOR JARSIGNER
.PP
The following sections describe the options for the \f[V]jarsigner\f[R].
Be aware of the following standards:
.IP \[bu] 2
All option names are preceded by a hyphen sign (-).
.IP \[bu] 2
The options can be provided in any order.

TSA-related options are only relevant when signing a JAR file; they
aren\[aq]t relevant when verifying a signed JAR file.
The \f[V]-keystore\f[R] option is relevant for signing and verifying a

By default, this header is added, as an optimization.
When the header is present, whenever the JAR file is verified, the
verification can first check to see whether the hash in the header

When there is no match, it is necessary to do a less optimized
verification that the hash in each source file information section in

.SH EXAMPLE OF VERIFICATION WITH CERTIFICATE INFORMATION
.PP
If you specify the \f[V]-certs\f[R] option with the \f[V]-verify\f[R]
and \f[V]-verbose\f[R] options, then the output includes certificate
information for each signer of the JAR file.
The information includes the certificate type, the signer distinguished
name information (when it is an X.509 certificate), and in parentheses,
the keystore alias for the signer when the public key certificate in the
JAR file matches the one in a keystore entry, for example:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jarsigner -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts -verify -verbose -certs ButtonDemo.jar

If the certificate for a signer isn\[aq]t an X.509 certificate, then
there is no distinguished name information.
In that case, just the certificate type and the alias are shown.
For example, if the certificate is a PGP certificate, and the alias is
\f[V]bob\f[R], then you would get: \f[V]PGP, (bob)\f[R].
