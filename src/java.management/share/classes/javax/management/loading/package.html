      <p>Provides the classes which implement advanced dynamic
	loading.  See the chapter <em>Advanced Dynamic Loading</em> in
	the <a href="#spec">JMX Specification</a>.</p>

      <p>An MBean that is of a subclass of {@link
	java.lang.ClassLoader} can be used as a class loader to create
	other MBeans via the method {@link
	javax.management.MBeanServer#createMBean(String, ObjectName,
	ObjectName, Object[], String[])}, and to instantiate arbitrary
	objects via the method {@link
	javax.management.MBeanServer#instantiate(String, ObjectName,
	Object[], String[])}.</p>

      <p>Every MBean Server has a <em>class loader repository</em>
	containing all MBeans registered in that MBean Server that
	are of a subclass of {@link java.lang.ClassLoader}.  The class
	loader repository is used by the forms of the
	<code>createMBean</code> and <code>instantiate</code> methods
	in the {@link javax.management.MBeanServer MBeanServer}
	interface that do not have an explicit loader parameter.</p>

      <p>If an MBean implements the interface {@link
	javax.management.loading.PrivateClassLoader PrivateClassLoader},
	then it is not added to the class loader repository.</p>
