.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
JShell provides a way to interactively evaluate declarations,
statements, and expressions of the Java programming language, making it
easier to learn the language, explore unfamiliar code and APIs, and
prototype complex code.
Java statements, variable definitions, method definitions, class
definitions, import statements, and expressions are accepted.
The bits of code entered are called snippets.
.PP
As snippets are entered, they\[aq]re evaluated, and feedback is
provided.
Feedback varies from the results and explanations of actions to nothing,
depending on the snippet entered and the feedback mode chosen.
Errors are described regardless of the feedback mode.
Start with the verbose mode to get the most feedback while learning the
tool.
.PP
Command-line options are available for configuring the initial
environment when JShell is started.
Within JShell, commands are available for modifying the environment as
needed.
.PP
Existing snippets can be loaded from a file to initialize a JShell
session, or at any time within a session.
Snippets can be modified within the session to try out different
variations and make corrections.
To keep snippets for later use, save them to a file.
.SH OPTIONS FOR JSHELL
.TP
\f[V]--add-exports\f[R] \f[I]module\f[R]/\f[I]package\f[R]
Specifies a package to be considered as exported from its defining
module.
.TP
\f[V]--add-modules\f[R] \f[I]module\f[R][\f[V],\f[R]\f[I]module\f[R]...]
Specifies the root modules to resolve in addition to the initial module.
.TP
\f[V]-C\f[R]\f[I]flag\f[R]
passes \f[I]flag\f[R] to the Java compiler inside JShell.
For example, \f[V]-C-Xlint\f[R] enables all the recommended lint
warnings, and \f[V]-C--release=<N>\f[R] compiles for Java SE N, as if
--release N was specified.
.TP
\f[V]--class-path\f[R] \f[I]path\f[R]
Specifies the directories and archives that are searched to locate class
files.
This option overrides the path in the \f[V]CLASSPATH\f[R] environment
variable.
If the environment variable isn\[aq]t set and this option isn\[aq]t
used, then the current directory is searched.
For Linux and macOS, use a colon (:) to separate items in the path.
For Windows, use a semicolon (;) to separate items.
.TP
\f[V]--enable-preview\f[R]
Allows code to depend on the preview features of this release.
.TP
\f[V]--execution\f[R] \f[I]specification\f[R]
Specifies an alternate execution engine, where \f[I]specification\f[R]
is an ExecutionControl spec.
See the documentation of the package jdk.jshell.spi for the syntax of
the spec.
.TP
\f[V]--feedback\f[R] \f[I]mode\f[R]
Sets the initial level of feedback provided in response to what\[aq]s
entered.
The initial level can be overridden within a session by using the
\f[V]/set feedback\f[R] \f[I]mode\f[R] command.
The default is \f[V]normal\f[R].
.RS
.PP
The following values are valid for \f[I]mode\f[R]:
.TP
\f[V]verbose\f[R]
Provides detailed feedback for entries.
Additional information about the action performed is displayed after the
result of the action.
The next prompt is separated from the feedback by a blank line.
.TP
\f[V]normal\f[R]
Provides an average amount of feedback.
The next prompt is separated from the feedback by a blank line.
.TP
\f[V]concise\f[R]
Provides minimal feedback.
The next prompt immediately follows the code snippet or feedback.
.TP
\f[V]silent\f[R]
Provides no feedback.
The next prompt immediately follows the code snippet.
.TP
\f[I]custom\f[R]
Provides custom feedback based on how the mode is defined.
Custom feedback modes are created within JShell by using the
\f[V]/set mode\f[R] command.
.RE
.TP
\f[V]--help\f[R] or \f[V]-h\f[R] or \f[V]-?\f[R]
Prints a summary of standard options and exits the tool.
.TP

.TP
\f[V]-J\f[R]\f[I]flag\f[R]
passes \f[I]flag\f[R] to the runtime system, but has no effect on the
execution of code snippets.
To specify flags that affect the execution of code snippets, use
\f[V]-R\f[R]\f[I]flag\f[R].
Alternatively, use \f[V]-J\f[R]\f[I]flag\f[R] with
\f[V]--execution local\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]--module-path\f[R] \f[I]modulepath\f[R]
Specifies where to find application modules.
For Linux and macOS, use a colon (:) to separate items in the path.
For Windows, use a semicolon (;) to separate items.
.TP
\f[V]--no-startup\f[R]
Prevents startup scripts from running when JShell starts.
Use this option to run only the scripts entered on the command line when
JShell is started, or to start JShell without any preloaded information
if no scripts are entered.
This option can\[aq]t be used if the \f[V]--startup\f[R] option is used.
.TP
\f[V]-q\f[R]
Sets the feedback mode to \f[V]concise\f[R], which is the same as
entering \f[V]--feedback concise\f[R].

passes \f[I]flag\f[R] to the runtime system only when code snippets are
executed.
For example, \f[V]-R-Dfoo=bar\f[R] means that execution of the snippet
\f[V]System.getProperty(\[dq]foo\[dq])\f[R] will return
\f[V]\[dq]bar\[dq]\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]-s\f[R]
Sets the feedback mode to \f[V]silent\f[R], which is the same as
entering \f[V]--feedback silent\f[R].

.SH EXAMPLE OF CREATING A CUSTOM FEEDBACK MODE
.PP
The feedback mode determines the prompt that\[aq]s displayed, the
feedback messages that are provided as snippets are entered, and the
maximum length of a displayed value.
Predefined feedback modes are provided.
Commands for creating custom feedback modes are also provided.
.PP
Use the \f[V]/set mode\f[R] command to create a new feedback mode.
In the following example, the new mode \f[V]mymode\f[R], is based on the
predefined feedback mode, \f[V]normal\f[R], and verifying command
feedback is displayed:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell> /set mode mymode normal -command
|  Created new feedback mode: mymode
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Because the new mode is based on the \f[V]normal\f[R] mode, the prompts
are the same.
The following example shows how to see what prompts are used and then
changes the prompts to custom strings.
The first string represents the standard JShell prompt.
The second string represents the prompt for additional lines in
multiline snippets.
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell> /set prompt mymode
|  /set prompt mymode \[dq]\[rs]njshell> \[dq] \[dq]   ...> \[dq]

jshell> /set prompt mymode \[dq]\[rs]nprompt$ \[dq] \[dq]   continue$ \[dq]
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The maximum length of a displayed value is controlled by the truncation
setting.
Different types of values can have different lengths.
The following example sets an overall truncation value of 72, and a
truncation value of 500 for variable value expressions:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell> /set truncation mymode 72

jshell> /set truncation mymode 500 varvalue
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The feedback displayed after snippets are entered is controlled by the
format setting and is based on the type of snippet entered and the
action taken for that snippet.
In the predefined mode \f[V]normal\f[R], the string \f[V]created\f[R] is
displayed when a method is created.
The following example shows how to change that string to
\f[V]defined\f[R]:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
jshell> /set format mymode action \[dq]defined\[dq] added-primary
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Use the \f[V]/set feedback\f[R] command to start using the feedback mode
that was just created.
The following example shows the custom mode in use:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
