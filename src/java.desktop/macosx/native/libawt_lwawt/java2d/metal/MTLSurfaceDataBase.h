/**
 * The MTLSDOps structure describes a native Metal surface and contains all
 * information pertaining to the native surface.  Some information about
 * the more important/different fields:
 *
 *     void *privOps;
 * Pointer to native-specific (Metal) SurfaceData info, such as the
 * native Drawable handle and GraphicsConfig data.
 *
 *     jint drawableType;
 * The surface type; can be any one of the surface type constants defined
 * below (MTLSD_WINDOW, MTLSD_TEXTURE, etc).
 *
 *     jboolean isOpaque;
 * If true, the surface should be treated as being fully opaque.  If
 * the underlying surface (e.g. pbuffer) has an alpha channel and isOpaque
 * is true, then we should take appropriate action (i.e. call glColorMask()
 * to disable writes into the alpha channel) to ensure that the surface
 * remains fully opaque.
 *
 *     jint x/yOffset
 * The offset in pixels of the Metal viewport origin from the lower-left
 * corner of the heavyweight drawable.  For example, a top-level frame on
 * Windows XP has lower-left insets of (4,4).  The Metal viewport origin
 * would typically begin at the lower-left corner of the client region (inside
 * the frame decorations), but AWT/Swing will take the insets into account
 * when rendering into that window.  So in order to account for this, we
 * need to adjust the Metal viewport origin by an x/yOffset of (-4,-4).  On
 * X11, top-level frames typically don't have this insets issue, so their
 * x/yOffset would be (0,0) (the same applies to pbuffers).
 *
 *     jint width/height;
 * The cached surface bounds.  For offscreen surface types (MTLSD_FBOBJECT,
 * MTLSD_TEXTURE, etc.) these values must remain constant.  Onscreen window
 * surfaces (MTLSD_WINDOW, MTLSD_FLIP_BACKBUFFER, etc.) may have their
 * bounds changed in response to a programmatic or user-initiated event, so
 * these values represent the last known dimensions.  To determine the true
 * current bounds of this surface, query the native Drawable through the
 * privOps field.
 *
 *     void* pTexture;
 * The texture object handle, as generated by MTLTextureDescriptor(). If this
 * value is null, the texture has not yet been initialized.
 *
 *     jint textureWidth/Height;
 * The actual bounds of the texture object for this surface.
 * The texture image that we care about has dimensions specified by the width
 * and height fields in this MTLSDOps structure.
