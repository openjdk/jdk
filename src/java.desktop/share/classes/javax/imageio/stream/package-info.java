/**
 * A package of the Java Image I/O API dealing with low-level I/O from files and
 * streams.
 * <p>
 * The {@code ImageInputStream} interface unifies streaming and file-based
 * operations. An abstract base class, {@code ImageInputStreamImpl} is provided
 * to simplify writing a new {@code ImageInputStream} class. Concrete
 * implementation classes ({@code FileImageInputStream},
 * {@code FileCacheImageInputStream}, and {@code MemoryCacheImageInputStream})
 * are provided that allow input to come from a {@code File} or
 * {@code InputStream} with or without the use of a temporary cache file.
 * <p>
 * The {@code ImageOutputStream} interface performs an analogous function for
 * output. An abstract base class, {@code ImageOutputStreamImpl} is provided,
 * along with concrete implementation classes ({@code FileImageOutputStream},
 * {@code FileCacheImageOutputStream}, and {@code MemoryCacheImageOutputStream})
 * are provided that allow output to go to a {@code File} or
 * {@code OutputStream} with or without the use of a temporary cache file.
 * <p>
 * The {@code IIOByteBuffer} class provides an alternative way to perform reads
 * of sequences of bytes that reduces the amount of internal data copying.
 * <p>
 * An {@code ImageInputStream} or {@code ImageOutputStream} may internally allocate
 * system resources, such as a temporary cache file.
 * Clients are encouraged to use a try-with-resources statement to ensure the
 * {@link ImageInputStream#close()} or {@link ImageOutputStream#close()}
 * method is called which can promptly free those native resources.
 * Otherwise there is the possibility they will leak and eventually cause the
 * application to fail as well the possibility that not all data is flushed
 * to the underlying output stream. A logical consequence of that is that
 * this should be done before closing the destination {@link java.io.OutputStream}.
 * A simple pattern would be
 * {@snippet lang='java':
 * try (FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream("out.jpg");
 *      ImageOutputStream ios = new FileCacheImageOutputStream(fos, null)) {
 *     ImageIO.write(img, "jpg", ios);
 * } catch (IOException e) {
 * } // implicit finally block closes the streams in the reverse order to opening
 * }
 * <p>
 * Sub-classers of these Image I/O API stream types can, to a limited extent, protect
 * the application from the consequences of failures to close by adopting mechanisms
 * such as {@link java.lang.ref.Cleaner} to free internal resources when it
 * is no longer reachable. This is only necessary if there are any resources to release.
 * However applications cannot rely on this, either for resource management, or
 * for program correctness.
 * @since 1.4
