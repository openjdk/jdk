Tips and tasks when updating harfbuzz sources to a newer version.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

STEP 1: UPDATING FILES
----------------------
Download and unzip the latest version from https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz/releases
We only use files from the src directory and even then only the ones we need.
So just C++ include and source files and only the ones needed for the library,
and even then just the ones we use.
IMPORTANT! DO NOT just copy everything.

- Harfbuzz is not modular, so the update is not a straightforward process.
- The main thing is we do NOT want any
   * "test" programs (test in the name, have a main are clues)
   * support for (eg) GLib, DirectWrite, Graphite, GDI, ICU, Uniscribe
   * aggregators like harfbuzz.cc - since it includes things from the above
     as well as hb-ft.cc which we specifically exclude in the Makefile
   * but we do use core text support on macOS.
   * I really wish that "src" were just library source, but I expect the authors
    have their reasons.

So one way to update is to

- copy over from the updated harfbuzz the exact same files we already have
- it isn't a flat directory so watch out for that.

- For files that are no longer available (for which copy fails), we remove such files,
  but these may come back later if they were actually renamed.

- look for files in the destination that were NOT updated - perhaps they
  are removed or renamed in the upstream. Remove them if they are really
  obsolete, or add their replacements/renames.
  In IntelliJ IDE:
    Newly added files are shown in RED
    Modified in BLUE
    NOT Updated in WHITE
  This feature might be helpful to keep track of new, modified and unchanged files.


STEP 2: BUILD CHANGES INCREMENTALLY
-----------------------------------
- iterate over : build and see what new file is missing that causes a build failure.
  Sometimes just running a build does not show up any failures due to stale files.
  Clean followed by build would be helpful in this situation.

- You might run into compiler warnings that are treated as errors or the requirement
  to set certain compiler flags if the build fails on a specific platform.
  Check "COMPILER WARNINGS AND SETTING FLAGS" section for more details.

- when this is done we have something buildable, make sure it builds
  on all supported platforms.


STEP 3: COMPILER WARNINGS AND SETTING FLAGS
-------------------------------------------
- Update make parameters in Awt2DLibraries.gmk
  Since we don't use configure we need to manually specify the options
  we need in the Harfbuzz section of Awt2DLibraries.gmk.
  As well as adding new options, we may need to clean up obsolete options.
  Note there may be platform variations in the flags.

- As with other 3rd party libs we do not fix the code to eliminate compiler
  warnings unless they are critical and clearly avoiding a bug. Even then
  we'd report it upstream and apply the patch once it is made available.
  The usual practice is do just disable the warnings.


STEP 4: UPDATING .md FILE
-------------------------
- we do not apply any header file changes so this is not an issue.

- verify the license text is unchanged (extra steps are needed if it is) and update
  src/java.desktop/share/legal/harfbuzz.md with the new version.


STEP 5: REPLACE TABS & REMOVE TRAILING SPACES
---------------------------------------------
- clean up trailing white space and tabs to follow jcheck rules.
  Use "expand" and "sed" to remove tabs and trailing white space from the
  imported sources.
  To clean up the extra spaces and tabs run the following script at
  each folder level within libharfbuzz.

  shopt -s nullglob
  for f in *.c *.h *.cc *.hh;
      do
          # replace tabs with spaces
          expand ${f} > ${f}.tmp;
          mv ${f}.tmp $f;

          # fix line endings to LF
          sed -e 's/\r$//g' ${f} > ${f}.tmp;
          mv ${f}.tmp $f;

          # remove trailing spaces
          sed -e 's/[ ]* $//g' ${f} > ${f}.tmp;
          mv ${f}.tmp $f;
      done


STEP 6: TESTING
---------------
- test using all the automated jtreg tests on all platforms.

- do MANUAL verification of Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Indic against previous releases.
  Look for manual related layout jtreg tests (test/jdk/java/awt/font/TextLayout)
  and run on Windows,Linux and Mac.
  Use Font2DTest set to TextLayout and check the above languages. Probably
  not going to see layout problems in code at this point of time but it needs to
  be checked.

  Different unicode combinations can be checked using Font2DTest.
  Run Font2DTest, select 'UserText' option for 'Text to use'.
  Paste unicodes of different languages (Arabic, Hebrew, Thai, Indic)
  and compare the glyphs with previous versions.
  It should look the same in both cases.


- FINALLY, Do update THIS UPDATING.txt file too if it is outdated.
