rmid \- start the activation system daemon that enables objects to be
registered and activated in a Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] [\f[I]options\f[R]]
.TP
.B \f[I]options\f[R]
This represent the command\-line options for the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command.
See \f[B]Options for rmid\f[R].
.RS
.RE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]Deprecation Notice:\f[R] The rmid tool and the RMI Activation
mechanism have been deprecated and may be removed from a future version
of the platform.
See \f[B]JEP 385\f[R] [https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/385] for further
information.
.PP
The \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command starts the activation system daemon.
The activation system daemon must be started before objects that can be
activated are either registered with the activation system or activated
in a JVM.
.PP
Start the daemon by executing the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command and specifying a
security policy file, as follows:
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\ \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy\f[R]
.RE
.PP
When you run Oracle\[aq]s implementation of the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command,
by default you must specify a security policy file so that the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command can verify whether or not the information in each
\f[CB]ActivationGroupDesc\f[R] is allowed to be used to start a JVM for an
activation group.
Specifically, the command and options specified by the
\f[CB]CommandEnvironment\f[R] and any properties passed to an
\f[CB]ActivationGroupDesc\f[R] constructor must now be explicitly allowed
in the security policy file for the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command.
The value of the \f[CB]sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy\f[R] property
dictates the policy that the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command uses to determine
whether or not the information in an \f[CB]ActivationGroupDesc\f[R] can be
used to start a JVM for an activation group.
For more information see the description of the
\f[CB]\-J\-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=policy\f[R] option.
.PP
Executing the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command starts the \f[CB]Activator\f[R] and an
internal registry on the default port 1098 and binds an
\f[CB]ActivationSystem\f[R] to the name
\f[CB]java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem\f[R] in this internal registry.
.PP
To specify an alternate port for the registry, you must specify the
\f[CB]\-port\f[R] option when you execute the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command.
For example, the following command starts the activation system daemon
and a registry on the registry\[aq]s default port, 1099.
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\ \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy\ \-port\ 1099\f[R]
.RE
.SH START RMID ON DEMAND (LINUX ONLY)
.PP
An alternative to starting \f[CB]rmid\f[R] from the command line is to
configure \f[CB]xinetd\f[R] (Linux) to start \f[CB]rmid\f[R] on demand.
.PP
When RMID starts, it attempts to obtain an inherited channel (inherited
from \f[CB]inetd\f[R]/\f[CB]xinetd\f[R]) by calling the
\f[CB]System.inheritedChannel\f[R] method.
If the inherited channel is null or not an instance of
\f[CB]java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel\f[R], then RMID assumes that
it wasn\[aq]t started by \f[CB]inetd\f[R]/\f[CB]xinetd\f[R], and it starts
as previously described.
.PP
If the inherited channel is a \f[CB]ServerSocketChannel\f[R] instance,
then RMID uses the \f[CB]java.net.ServerSocket\f[R] obtained from the
\f[CB]ServerSocketChannel\f[R] as the server socket that accepts requests
for the remote objects it exports: The registry in which the
\f[CB]java.rmi.activation.ActivationSystem\f[R] is bound and the
\f[CB]java.rmi.activation.Activator\f[R] remote object.
In this mode, RMID behaves the same as when it is started from the
command line, except in the following cases:
.IP \[bu] 2
Output printed to \f[CB]System.err\f[R] is redirected to a file.
This file is located in the directory specified by the
\f[CB]java.io.tmpdir\f[R] system property (typically \f[CB]/var/tmp\f[R] or
\f[CB]/tmp\f[R]) with the prefix \f[CB]rmid\-err\f[R] and the suffix
\f[CB]tmp\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CB]\-port\f[R] option isn\[aq]t allowed.
If this option is specified, then RMID exits with an error message.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[CB]\-log\f[R] option is required.
If this option isn\[aq]t specified, then RMID exits with an error
message
.SH OPTIONS FOR RMID
.TP
.B \f[CB]\-C\f[R]\f[I]option\f[R]
Specifies an option that\[aq]s passed as a command\-line argument to
each child process (activation group) of the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command when
that process is created.
For example, you could pass a property to each virtual machine spawned
by the activation system daemon:
.RS
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\ \-C\-Dsome.property=value\f[R]
.RE
.PP
This ability to pass command\-line arguments to child processes can be
useful for debugging.
For example, the following command enables server\-call logging in all
child JVMs.
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\ \-C\-Djava.rmi.server.logCalls=true\f[R]
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \f[CB]\-J\f[R]\f[I]option\f[R]
Specifies an option that\[aq]s passed to the Java interpreter running
RMID command.
For example, to specify that the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command use a policy file
named \f[CB]rmid.policy\f[R], the \f[CB]\-J\f[R] option can be used to
define the \f[CB]java.security.policy\f[R] property on the \f[CB]rmid\f[R]
command line, for example:
.RS
.RS
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\ \-J\-Djava.security.policy\-rmid.policy\f[R]
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \f[CB]\-J\-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=\f[R]\f[I]policy\f[R]
Specifies the policy that the RMID command employs to check commands and
command\-line options used to start the JVM in which an activation group
runs.
This option exists only in Oracle\[aq]s implementation of the Java RMI
activation daemon.
If this property isn\[aq]t specified on the command line, then the
result is the same as though
\f[CB]\-J\-Dsun.rmi.activation.execPolicy=default\f[R] were specified.
.RS
.PP
The possible values of \f[I]policy\f[R] can be \f[CB]default\f[R],
\f[I]policyClassName\f[R], or \f[CB]none\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CB]default\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
The \f[CB]default\f[R] or unspecified value \f[CB]execPolicy\f[R] allows the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to execute commands with specific command\-line
options only when the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command was granted permission to
execute those commands and options in the security policy file that the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command uses.
Only the default activation group implementation can be used with the
default execution policy.
.PP
The \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command starts a JVM for an activation group with the
information in the group\[aq]s registered activation group descriptor,
\f[CB]ActivationGroupDesc\f[R].
The group descriptor specifies an optional
\f[CB]ActivationGroupDesc.CommandEnvironment\f[R] that includes the
command to execute to start the activation group and any command\-line
options to be added to the command line.
By default, the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command uses the \f[CB]java\f[R] command
found in \f[CB]java.home\f[R].
The group descriptor also contains properties overrides that are added
to the command line as options defined as:
\f[CB]\-D\f[R]\f[I]property\f[R]\f[CB]=\f[R]\f[I]value\f[R].
The \f[CB]com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecPermission\f[R] permission grants the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command permission to execute a command that\[aq]s
specified in the group descriptor\[aq]s \f[CB]CommandEnvironment\f[R] to
start an activation group.
The \f[CB]com.sun.rmi.rmid.ExecOptionPermission\f[R] permission enables
the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to use command\-line options, specified as
properties overrides in the group descriptor or as options in the
\f[CB]CommandEnvironment\f[R] when starting the activation group.
When granting the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command permission to execute various
commands and options, the permissions \f[CB]ExecPermission\f[R] and
\f[CB]ExecOptionPermission\f[R] must be granted to all code sources.
.PP
\f[CB]ExecPermission\f[R] class: Represents permission for the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to execute a specific command to start an
activation group.
.PP
\f[CB]ExecPermission\f[R] syntax: The name of \f[CB]ExecPermission\f[R] is
the path name of a command to grant the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command permission
to execute.
.PP
A path name that ends in a slash (\f[CB]/\f[R]) and an asterisk
(\f[CB]*\f[R]) indicates that all of the files are contained in that
directory where the slash is the file\-separator character,
\f[CB]File.separatorChar\f[R].
.PP
A path name that ends in a slash (\f[CB]/\f[R]) and a minus sign
(\f[CB]\-\f[R]) indicates that all files and subdirectories are contained
in that directory (recursively).
.PP
A path name that consists of the special token \f[CB]<<ALL\ FILES>>\f[R]
matches any file.
.PP
A path name that consists of an asterisk (\f[CB]*\f[R]) indicates that all
the files are in the current directory.
.PP
A path name that consists of a minus sign (\f[CB]\-\f[R]) indicates that
all the files are in the current directory and (recursively) all files
and subdirectories are contained in the current directory.
.PP
\f[CB]ExecOptionPermission\f[R] class: Represents permission for the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to use a specific command\-line option when
starting an activation group.
The name of \f[CB]ExecOptionPermission\f[R] is the value of a
command\-line option.
.PP
\f[CB]ExecOptionPermission\f[R] syntax: Options support a limited wild
card scheme.
An asterisk signifies a wild card match, and it can appear as the option
name itself (matches any option), or an asterisk (*) can appear at the
end of the option name only when the asterisk (\f[CB]*\f[R]) follows a dot
(\f[CB]\&.\f[R]) or an equals sign (\f[CB]=\f[R]).
.PP
For example: \f[CB]*\f[R] or \f[CB]\-Dmydir.*\f[R] or \f[CB]\-Da.b.c=*\f[R] is
valid, but \f[CB]*mydir\f[R] or \f[CB]\-Da*b\f[R] or \f[CB]ab*\f[R] isn\[aq]t
valid.
.PP
\f[B]Policy file for rmid\f[R]
.PP
When you grant the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command permission to execute various
commands and options, the permissions \f[CB]ExecPermission\f[R] and
\f[CB]ExecOptionPermission\f[R] must be granted to all code sources
(universally).
It is safe to grant these permissions universally because only the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command checks these permissions.
.PP
An example policy file that grants various execute permissions to the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command is:

.PP
The first permission granted allows the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to execute
the 1.7.0 release of the \f[CB]java\f[R] command, specified by its
explicit path name.
By default, the version of the \f[CB]java\f[R] command found in
\f[CB]java.home\f[R] is used (the same one that the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command
uses), and doesn\[aq]t need to be specified in the policy file.
The second permission allows the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to execute any
command in either the directory \f[CB]/files/apps/rmidcmds\f[R] (Linux and
macOS) or the directory \f[CB]c:\\files\\apps\\rmidcmds\\\f[R] (Windows).
.PP
The third permission granted, \f[CB]ExecOptionPermission\f[R], allows the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command to start an activation group that defines the
security policy file to be either \f[CB]/files/policies/group.policy\f[R]
(Linux) or \f[CB]c:\\files\\policies\\group.policy\f[R] (Windows).
The next permission allows the \f[CB]java.security.debug\ property\f[R] to
be used by an activation group.
The last permission allows any property in the
\f[CB]sun.rmi\ property\f[R] name hierarchy to be used by activation
groups.
.PP
To start the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command with a policy file, the
\f[CB]java.security.policy\f[R] property needs to be specified on the
\f[CB]rmid\f[R] command line, for example:
.PP
\f[CB]rmid\ \-J\-Djava.security.policy=rmid.policy\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]policyClassName\f[R]
.RS 2
.PP
If the default behavior isn\[aq]t flexible enough, then an administrator
can provide, when starting the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command, the name of a
class whose \f[CB]checkExecCommand\f[R] method is executed to check
commands to be executed by the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command.
.PP
The \f[CB]policyClassName\f[R] specifies a public class with a public,
no\-argument constructor and an implementation of the following
\f[CB]checkExecCommand\f[R] method:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
\ public\ void\ checkExecCommand(ActivationGroupDesc\ desc,\ String[]\ command)
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ throws\ SecurityException;
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Before starting an activation group, the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command calls the
policy\[aq]s \f[CB]checkExecCommand\f[R] method and passes to it the
activation group descriptor and an array that contains the complete
command to start the activation group.
If the \f[CB]checkExecCommand\f[R] throws a \f[CB]SecurityException\f[R],
then the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command doesn\[aq]t start the activation group
and an \f[CB]ActivationException\f[R] is thrown to the caller attempting
to activate the object.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[CB]none\f[R]

If the \f[CB]sun.rmi.activation.execPolicy\f[R] property value is
\f[CB]none\f[R], then the \f[CB]rmid\f[R] command doesn\[aq]t perform any
validation of commands to start activation groups.
.RE
.RE
.TP
.B \f[CB]\-log\f[R] \f[I]dir\f[R]

The \f[CB]ActivationSystem\f[R] on the local machine can be obtained using
the following \f[CB]Naming.lookup\f[R] method call:
