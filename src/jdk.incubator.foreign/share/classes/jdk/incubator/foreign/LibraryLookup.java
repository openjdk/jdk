/**
 * A native library lookup. Exposes a lookup operation for searching symbols, see {@link LibraryLookup#lookup(String)}.
 * A given native library remains loaded as long as there is at least one <em>live</em> library lookup instance referring
 * to it.
 * All instances generated by a given library lookup object contain a strong reference to said lookup object,
 * therefore preventing library unloading. For {@link #lookup(String, MemoryLayout) memory segments} obtained from a library lookup object,
 * this means that clients can safely dereference memory associated with lookup symbols, as follows:
 * <pre>{@code
 * LibraryLookup defaultLookup = LibraryLookup.ofDefault();
 * MemorySegment errnoSegment = defaultLookup.lookup("errno", MemoryLayouts.JAVA_INT).get();
 * int errno = MemoryAccess.getInt(errnoSegment);
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * For {@link #lookup(String) memory addresses} obtained from a library lookup object,
 * since {@link CLinker#downcallHandle(Addressable, MethodType, FunctionDescriptor) native method handles}
 * also maintain a strong reference to the addressable parameter used for their construction, there is
 * always a strong reachability chain from a native method handle to a lookup object (the one that was used to lookup
 * the native library symbol the method handle refers to). This is useful to prevent situations where a native library
 * is unloaded in the middle of a native call.
 * <p>
 * To allow for a library to be unloaded, a client will have to discard any strong references it
 * maintains, directly, or indirectly to a lookup object associated with given library.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument, or an array argument containing one or more {@code null}
 * elements to a method in this class causes a {@link NullPointerException NullPointerException} to be thrown. </p>
