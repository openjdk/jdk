.RE
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBjava\fR
command starts a Java application\&. It does this by starting the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), loading the specified class, and calling that class\*(Aqs
\fBmain()\fR
method\&. The method must be declared
\fIpublic\fR
and
\fIstatic\fR, it must not return any value, and it must accept a
\fBString\fR
array as a parameter\&. The method declaration has the following form:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fBpublic static void main(String[] args)\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
The
\fBjava\fR
command can be used to launch a JavaFX application by loading a class that either has a
\fBmain()\fR
method or that extends
\fBjavafx\&.application\&.Application\fR\&. In the latter case, the launcher constructs an instance of the
\fBApplication\fR
class, calls its
\fBinit()\fR
method, and then calls the
\fBstart(javafx\&.stage\&.Stage)\fR
method\&.
.PP
By default, the first argument that is not an option of the
\fBjava\fR
command is the fully qualified name of the class to be called\&. If the
\fB\-jar\fR
option is specified, its argument is the name of the JAR file containing class and resource files for the application\&. The startup class must be indicated by the
\fBMain\-Class\fR
manifest header in its source code\&.
.PP
The JRE searches for the startup class (and other classes used by the application) in three sets of locations: the bootstrap class path, the installed extensions, and the user\(cqs class path\&.
.PP
Arguments after the class file name or the JAR file name are passed to the
\fBmain()\fR
method\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"

The
\fBjava\fR

Advanced Garbage Collection Options
.RE
.PP
Standard options are guaranteed to be supported by all implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)\&. They are used for common actions, such as checking the version of the JRE, setting the class path, enabling verbose output, and so on\&.
.PP
Non\-standard options are general purpose options that are specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine, so they are not guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations, and are subject to change\&. These options start with
\fB\-X\fR\&.
.PP
Advanced options are not recommended for casual use\&. These are developer options used for tuning specific areas of the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine operation that often have specific system requirements and may require privileged access to system configuration parameters\&. They are also not guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations, and are subject to change\&. Advanced options start with
\fB\-XX\fR\&.
.PP
To keep track of the options that were deprecated or removed in the latest release, there is a section named Deprecated and Removed Options at the end of the document\&.
.PP
Boolean options are used to either enable a feature that is disabled by default or disable a feature that is enabled by default\&. Such options do not require a parameter\&. Boolean
\fB\-XX\fR
options are enabled using the plus sign (\fB\-XX:+\fR\fIOptionName\fR) and disabled using the minus sign (\fB\-XX:\-\fR\fIOptionName\fR)\&.
.PP
For options that require an argument, the argument may be separated from the option name by a space, a colon (:), or an equal sign (=), or the argument may directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs for each option)\&. If you are expected to specify the size in bytes, you can use no suffix, or use the suffix
\fBk\fR
or
\fBK\fR
for kilobytes (KB),
\fBm\fR
or
\fBM\fR
for megabytes (MB),
\fBg\fR
or
\fBG\fR
for gigabytes (GB)\&. For example, to set the size to 8 GB, you can specify either
\fB8g\fR,
\fB8192m\fR,
\fB8388608k\fR, or
\fB8589934592\fR
as the argument\&. If you are expected to specify the percentage, use a number from 0 to 1 (for example, specify
\fB0\&.25\fR
for 25%)\&.
.SS "Standard Options"
.PP
These are the most commonly used options that are supported by all implementations of the JVM\&.
.PP
\-agentlib:\fIlibname\fR[=\fIoptions\fR]
.RS 4
Loads the specified native agent library\&. After the library name, a comma\-separated list of options specific to the library can be used\&.
.sp
If the option
\fB\-agentlib:foo\fR
is specified, then the JVM attempts to load the library named
\fBlibfoo\&.so\fR
in the location specified by the
\fBLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR
system variable (on OS X this variable is
\fBDYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\fR)\&.
.sp
The following example shows how to load the heap profiling tool (HPROF) library and get sample CPU information every 20 ms, with a stack depth of 3:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,interval=20,depth=3\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
The following example shows how to load the Java Debug Wire Protocol (JDWP) library and listen for the socket connection on port 8000, suspending the JVM before the main class loads:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,server=y,address=8000\fR
 
.fi

.PP
\-agentpath:\fIpathname\fR[=\fIoptions\fR]

Loads the native agent library specified by the absolute path name\&. This option is equivalent to
\fB\-agentlib\fR
but uses the full path and file name of the library\&.
.RE
.PP
\-client
.RS 4
Selects the Java HotSpot Client VM\&. The 64\-bit version of the Java SE Development Kit (JDK) currently ignores this option and instead uses the Server JVM\&.
.sp

http://docs\&.oracle\&.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/vm/server\-class\&.html
.RE
.PP
\-D\fIproperty\fR=\fIvalue\fR
.RS 4
Sets a system property value\&. The
\fIproperty\fR
variable is a string with no spaces that represents the name of the property\&. The
\fIvalue\fR
variable is a string that represents the value of the property\&. If
\fIvalue\fR
is a string with spaces, then enclose it in quotation marks (for example
\fB\-Dfoo="foo bar"\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d32
.RS 4
Runs the application in a 32\-bit environment\&. If a 32\-bit environment is not installed or is not supported, then an error will be reported\&. By default, the application is run in a 32\-bit environment unless a 64\-bit system is used\&.
.RE
.PP
\-d64
.RS 4
Runs the application in a 64\-bit environment\&. If a 64\-bit environment is not installed or is not supported, then an error will be reported\&. By default, the application is run in a 32\-bit environment unless a 64\-bit system is used\&.
.sp
Currently only the Java HotSpot Server VM supports 64\-bit operation, and the
\fB\-server\fR
option is implicit with the use of
\fB\-d64\fR\&. The
\fB\-client\fR
option is ignored with the use of
\fB\-d64\fR\&. This is subject to change in a future release\&.
.RE
.PP
\-disableassertions[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR]
.br
\-da[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR]
.RS 4
Disables assertions\&. By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes\&.
.sp
With no arguments,
\fB\-disableassertions\fR
(\fB\-da\fR) disables assertions in all packages and classes\&. With the
\fIpackagename\fR
argument ending in
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR, the switch disables assertions in the specified package and any subpackages\&. If the argument is simply
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR, then the switch disables assertions in the unnamed package in the current working directory\&. With the
\fIclassname\fR
argument, the switch disables assertions in the specified class\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-disableassertions\fR
(\fB\-da\fR) option applies to all class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class loader)\&. There is one exception to this rule: if the option is provided with no arguments, then it does not apply to system classes\&. This makes it easy to disable assertions in all classes except for system classes\&. The
\fB\-disablesystemassertions\fR
option enables you to disable assertions in all system classes\&.
.sp
To explicitly enable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the
\fB\-enableassertions\fR
(\fB\-ea\fR) option\&. Both options can be used at the same time\&. For example, to run the
\fBMyClass\fR
application with assertions enabled in package
\fBcom\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\fR
(and any subpackages) but disabled in class
\fBcom\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat\fR, use the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
\fBjava \-ea:com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.\&.\&. \-da:com\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat MyClass\fR

.br
\-ea[:[\fIpackagename\fR]\&.\&.\&.|:\fIclassname\fR]
.RS 4
Enables assertions\&. By default, assertions are disabled in all packages and classes\&.
.sp
With no arguments,
\fB\-enableassertions\fR
(\fB\-ea\fR) enables assertions in all packages and classes\&. With the
\fIpackagename\fR
argument ending in
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR, the switch enables assertions in the specified package and any subpackages\&. If the argument is simply
\fB\&.\&.\&.\fR, then the switch enables assertions in the unnamed package in the current working directory\&. With the
\fIclassname\fR
argument, the switch enables assertions in the specified class\&.
.sp
The
\fB\-enableassertions\fR
(\fB\-ea\fR) option applies to all class loaders and to system classes (which do not have a class loader)\&. There is one exception to this rule: if the option is provided with no arguments, then it does not apply to system classes\&. This makes it easy to enable assertions in all classes except for system classes\&. The
\fB\-enablesystemassertions\fR
option provides a separate switch to enable assertions in all system classes\&.
.sp
To explicitly disable assertions in specific packages or classes, use the
\fB\-disableassertions\fR
(\fB\-da\fR) option\&. If a single command contains multiple instances of these switches, then they are processed in order before loading any classes\&. For example, to run the
\fBMyClass\fR
application with assertions enabled only in package
\fBcom\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\fR
(and any subpackages) but disabled in class
\fBcom\&.wombat\&.fruitbat\&.Brickbat\fR, use the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\

command without actually running the JVM\&.
.RE
.PP
\-jar \fIfilename\fR
.RS 4
Executes a program encapsulated in a JAR file\&. The
\fIfilename\fR
argument is the name of a JAR file with a manifest that contains a line in the form
\fBMain\-Class:\fR\fIclassname\fR
that defines the class with the
\fBpublic static void main(String[] args)\fR
method that serves as your application\*(Aqs starting point\&.
.sp
When you use the
\fB\-jar\fR
option, the specified JAR file is the source of all user classes, and other class path settings are ignored\&.

.RS 4
Specifies the release version to be used for running the application\&. If the version of the

command called does not meet this specification and an appropriate implementation is found on the system, then the appropriate implementation will be used\&.
.sp
The
\fIrelease\fR
argument specifies either the exact version string, or a list of version strings and ranges separated by spaces\&. A
\fIversion string\fR
is the developer designation of the version number in the following form:
\fB1\&.\fR\fIx\fR\fB\&.0_\fR\fIu\fR
(where
\fIx\fR
is the major version number, and
\fIu\fR
is the update version number)\&. A
\fIversion range\fR
is made up of a version string followed by a plus sign (\fB+\fR) to designate this version or later, or a part of a version string followed by an asterisk (\fB*\fR) to designate any version string with a matching prefix\&. Version strings and ranges can be combined using a space for a logical
\fIOR\fR
combination, or an ampersand (\fB&\fR) for a logical
\fIAND\fR
combination of two version strings/ranges\&. For example, if running the class or JAR file requires either JRE 6u13 (1\&.6\&.0_13), or any JRE 6 starting from 6u10 (1\&.6\&.0_10), specify the following:
.sp
.if n \{\

The young generation region of the heap is used for new objects\&. GC is performed in this region more often than in other regions\&. If the size for the young generation is too small, then a lot of minor garbage collections will be performed\&.

Oracle recommends that you keep the size for the young generation between a half and a quarter of the overall heap size\&.

\-XX:CompileCommand=\fIcommand\fR,\fImethod\fR[,\fIoption\fR]
.RS 4
Specifies a command to perform on a method\&. For example, to exclude the

method of the
\fBString\fR
class from being compiled, use the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java/lang/String\&.indexOf\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

Note that the full class name is specified, including all packages and subpackages separated by a slash (\fB/\fR)\&. For easier cut and paste operations, it is also possible to use the method name format produced by the
\fB\-XX:+PrintCompilation\fR
and
\fB\-XX:+LogCompilation\fR
options:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,java\&.lang\&.String::indexOf\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
If the method is specified without the signature, the command will be applied to all methods with the specified name\&. However, you can also specify the signature of the method in the class file format\&. In this case, you should enclose the arguments in quotation marks, because otherwise the shell treats the semicolon as command end\&. For example, if you want to exclude only the
\fBindexOf(String)\fR
method of the
\fBString\fR
class from being compiled, use the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand="exclude,java/lang/String\&.indexOf,(Ljava/lang/String;)I"\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
You can also use the asterisk (*) as a wildcard for class and method names\&. For example, to exclude all
\fBindexOf()\fR
methods in all classes from being compiled, use the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand=exclude,*\&.indexOf\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
The commas and periods are aliases for spaces, making it easier to pass compiler commands through a shell\&. You can pass arguments to
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand\fR
using spaces as separators by enclosing the argument in quotation marks:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand="exclude java/lang/String indexOf"\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
Note that after parsing the commands passed on the command line using the
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand\fR
options, the JIT compiler then reads commands from the
\fB\&.hotspot_compiler\fR
file\&. You can add commands to this file or specify a different file using the
\fB\-XX:CompileCommandFile\fR
option\&.
.sp
To add several commands, either specify the
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand\fR
option multiple times, or separate each argument with the newline separator (\fB\en\fR)\&. The following commands are available:
.PP
break
.RS 4
Set a breakpoint when debugging the JVM to stop at the beginning of compilation of the specified method\&.
.RE

.RS 4
This command can be used to pass a JIT compilation option to the specified method in place of the last argument (\fIoption\fR)\&. The compilation option is set at the end, after the method name\&. For example, to enable the
\fBBlockLayoutByFrequency\fR
option for the
\fBappend()\fR
method of the
\fBStringBuffer\fR
class, use the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

.nf
\fB\-XX:CompileCommand=option,java/lang/StringBuffer\&.append,BlockLayoutByFrequency\fR
 
.fi
.if n \{\

Generate Restricted Transactional Memory (RTM) locking code for all inflated locks, with the normal locking mechanism as the fallback handler\&. This option is disabled by default\&. Options related to RTM are only available for the Java HotSpot Server VM on x86 CPUs that support Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX)\&.
.sp
RTM is part of Intel\*(Aqs TSX, which is an x86 instruction set extension and facilitates the creation of multithreaded applications\&. RTM introduces the new instructions
\fBXBEGIN\fR,
\fBXABORT\fR,
\fBXEND\fR, and
\fBXTEST\fR\&. The
\fBXBEGIN\fR
and
\fBXEND\fR
instructions enclose a set of instructions to run as a transaction\&. If no conflict is found when running the transaction, the memory and register modifications are committed together at the
\fBXEND\fR
instruction\&. The
\fBXABORT\fR
instruction can be used to explicitly abort a transaction and the
\fBXEND\fR
instruction to check if a set of instructions are being run in a transaction\&.
.sp
A lock on a transaction is inflated when another thread tries to access the same transaction, thereby blocking the thread that did not originally request access to the transaction\&. RTM requires that a fallback set of operations be specified in case a transaction aborts or fails\&. An RTM lock is a lock that has been delegated to the TSX\*(Aqs system\&.
.sp
RTM improves performance for highly contended locks with low conflict in a critical region (which is code that must not be accessed by more than one thread concurrently)\&. RTM also improves the performance of coarse\-grain locking, which typically does not perform well in multithreaded applications\&. (Coarse\-grain locking is the strategy of holding locks for long periods to minimize the overhead of taking and releasing locks, while fine\-grained locking is the strategy of trying to achieve maximum parallelism by locking only when necessary and unlocking as soon as possible\&.) Also, for lightly contended locks that are used by different threads, RTM can reduce false cache line sharing, also known as cache line ping\-pong\&. This occurs when multiple threads from different processors are accessing different resources, but the resources share the same cache line\&. As a result, the processors repeatedly invalidate the cache lines of other processors, which forces them to read from main memory instead of their cache\&.

.SH "LARGE PAGES"
.PP
Also known as huge pages, large pages are memory pages that are significantly larger than the standard memory page size (which varies depending on the processor and operating system)\&. Large pages optimize processor Translation\-Lookaside Buffers\&.
.PP
A Translation\-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a page translation cache that holds the most\-recently used virtual\-to\-physical address translations\&. TLB is a scarce system resource\&. A TLB miss can be costly as the processor must then read from the hierarchical page table, which may require multiple memory accesses\&. By using a larger memory page size, a single TLB entry can represent a larger memory range\&. There will be less pressure on TLB, and memory\-intensive applications may have better performance\&.
.PP
However, large pages page memory can negatively affect system performance\&. For example, when a large mount of memory is pinned by an application, it may create a shortage of regular memory and cause excessive paging in other applications and slow down the entire system\&. Also, a system that has been up for a long time could produce excessive fragmentation, which could make it impossible to reserve enough large page memory\&. When this happens, either the OS or JVM reverts to using regular pages\&.
