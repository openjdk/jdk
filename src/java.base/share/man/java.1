\f[I]module\f[R]\f[V]/\f[R]\f[I]mainclass\f[R] are passed as arguments
to the main class.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]java\f[R] command starts a Java application.
It does this by starting the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), loading the
specified class, and calling that class\[aq]s \f[V]main()\f[R] method.
The method must be declared \f[V]public\f[R] and \f[V]static\f[R], it
must not return any value, and it must accept a \f[V]String\f[R] array
as a parameter.
The method declaration has the following form:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]public static void main(String[] args)\f[R]
.RE
.PP
In source-file mode, the \f[V]java\f[R] command can launch a class
declared in a source file.
See \f[B]Using Source-File Mode to Launch Single-File Source-Code
Programs\f[R] for a description of using the source-file mode.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] You can use the \f[V]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] launcher
environment variable to prepend its content to the actual command line
of the \f[V]java\f[R] launcher.
See \f[B]Using the JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS Launcher Environment Variable\f[R].
.RE
.PP
By default, the first argument that isn\[aq]t an option of the
\f[V]java\f[R] command is the fully qualified name of the class to be
called.
If \f[V]-jar\f[R] is specified, then its argument is the name of the JAR
file containing class and resource files for the application.
The startup class must be indicated by the \f[V]Main-Class\f[R] manifest
header in its manifest file.
.PP
Arguments after the class file name or the JAR file name are passed to
the \f[V]main()\f[R] method.
.SS \f[V]javaw\f[R]
.PP
\f[B]Windows:\f[R] The \f[V]javaw\f[R] command is identical to
\f[V]java\f[R], except that with \f[V]javaw\f[R] there\[aq]s no
associated console window.
Use \f[V]javaw\f[R] when you don\[aq]t want a command prompt window to
appear.
The \f[V]javaw\f[R] launcher will, however, display a dialog box with
error information if a launch fails.
.SH USING SOURCE-FILE MODE TO LAUNCH SINGLE-FILE SOURCE-CODE PROGRAMS
.PP
To launch a class declared in a source file, run the \f[V]java\f[R]
launcher in source-file mode.
Entering source-file mode is determined by two items on the
\f[V]java\f[R] command line:
.IP \[bu] 2
The first item on the command line that is not an option or part of an
option.
In other words, the item in the command line that would otherwise be the
main class name.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[V]--source\f[R] \f[I]version\f[R] option, if present.
.PP
If the class identifies an existing file that has a \f[V].java\f[R]
extension, or if the \f[V]--source\f[R] option is specified, then
source-file mode is selected.
The source file is then compiled and run.
The \f[V]--source\f[R] option can be used to specify the source
\f[I]version\f[R] or \f[I]N\f[R] of the source code.
This determines the API that can be used.
When you set \f[V]--source\f[R] \f[I]N\f[R], you can only use the public
API that was defined in JDK \f[I]N\f[R].
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The valid values of \f[I]N\f[R] change for each release,
with new values added and old values removed.
You\[aq]ll get an error message if you use a value of \f[I]N\f[R] that
is no longer supported.
The supported values of \f[I]N\f[R] are the current Java SE release
(\f[V]20\f[R]) and a limited number of previous releases, detailed in
the command-line help for \f[V]javac\f[R], under the \f[V]--source\f[R]
and \f[V]--release\f[R] options.
.RE
.PP
If the file does not have the \f[V].java\f[R] extension, the
\f[V]--source\f[R] option must be used to tell the \f[V]java\f[R]
command to use the source-file mode.
The \f[V]--source\f[R] option is used for cases when the source file is
a \[dq]script\[dq] to be executed and the name of the source file does
not follow the normal naming conventions for Java source files.
.PP
In source-file mode, the effect is as though the source file is compiled
into memory, and the first class found in the source file is executed.
Any arguments placed after the name of the source file in the original
command line are passed to the compiled class when it is executed.
.PP
For example, if a file were named \f[V]HelloWorld.java\f[R] and
contained a class named \f[V]hello.World\f[R], then the source-file mode
command to launch the class would be:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java HelloWorld.java\f[R]
.RE
.PP
The example illustrates that the class can be in a named package, and
does not need to be in the unnamed package.
This use of source-file mode is informally equivalent to using the
following two commands where \f[V]hello.World\f[R] is the name of the
class in the package:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
javac -d <memory> HelloWorld.java
java -cp <memory> hello.World
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
\f[B]In source-file mode, any additional command-line options are
processed as follows:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
The launcher scans the options specified before the source file for any
that are relevant in order to compile the source file.
.RS 2
.PP
This includes: \f[V]--class-path\f[R], \f[V]--module-path\f[R],
\f[V]--add-exports\f[R], \f[V]--add-modules\f[R],
\f[V]--limit-modules\f[R], \f[V]--patch-module\f[R],
\f[V]--upgrade-module-path\f[R], and any variant forms of those options.
It also includes the new \f[V]--enable-preview\f[R] option, described in
JEP 12.
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
No provision is made to pass any additional options to the compiler,
such as \f[V]-processor\f[R] or \f[V]-Werror\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
Command-line argument files (\f[V]\[at]\f[R]-files) may be used in the
standard way.
Long lists of arguments for either the VM or the program being invoked
may be placed in files specified on the command-line by prefixing the
filename with an \f[V]\[at]\f[R] character.
.PP
\f[B]In source-file mode, compilation proceeds as follows:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
Any command-line options that are relevant to the compilation
environment are taken into account.
.IP \[bu] 2
No other source files are found and compiled, as if the source path is
set to an empty value.
.IP \[bu] 2
Annotation processing is disabled, as if \f[V]-proc:none\f[R] is in
effect.
.IP \[bu] 2
If a version is specified, via the \f[V]--source\f[R] option, the value
is used as the argument for an implicit \f[V]--release\f[R] option for
the compilation.
This sets both the source version accepted by compiler and the system
API that may be used by the code in the source file.
.IP \[bu] 2
The source file is compiled in the context of an unnamed module.
.IP \[bu] 2
The source file should contain one or more top-level classes, the first
of which is taken as the class to be executed.
.IP \[bu] 2
The compiler does not enforce the optional restriction defined at the
end of JLS 7.6, that a type in a named package should exist in a file
whose name is composed from the type name followed by the
\f[V].java\f[R] extension.
.IP \[bu] 2
If the source file contains errors, appropriate error messages are
written to the standard error stream, and the launcher exits with a
non-zero exit code.
.PP
\f[B]In source-file mode, execution proceeds as follows:\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
The class to be executed is the first top-level class found in the
source file.
It must contain a declaration of the standard
\f[V]public static void main(String[])\f[R] method.
.IP \[bu] 2
The compiled classes are loaded by a custom class loader, that delegates
to the application class loader.
This implies that classes appearing on the application class path cannot
refer to any classes declared in the source file.
.IP \[bu] 2
The compiled classes are executed in the context of an unnamed module,
as though \f[V]--add-modules=ALL-DEFAULT\f[R] is in effect.
This is in addition to any other \f[V]--add-module\f[R] options that may
be have been specified on the command line.
.IP \[bu] 2
Any arguments appearing after the name of the file on the command line
are passed to the standard main method in the obvious way.
.IP \[bu] 2
It is an error if there is a class on the application class path whose
name is the same as that of the class to be executed.
.PP

[https://openjdk.org/jeps/330] for complete details.
.SH USING THE JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS LAUNCHER ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE
.PP
\f[V]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] prepends its content to the options parsed
from the command line.
The content of the \f[V]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] environment variable is a
list of arguments separated by white-space characters (as determined by
\f[V]isspace()\f[R]).
These are prepended to the command line arguments passed to
\f[V]java\f[R] launcher.
The encoding requirement for the environment variable is the same as the
\f[V]java\f[R] command line on the system.
\f[V]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] environment variable content is treated in
the same manner as that specified in the command line.
.PP
Single (\f[V]\[aq]\f[R]) or double (\f[V]\[dq]\f[R]) quotes can be used
to enclose arguments that contain whitespace characters.
All content between the open quote and the first matching close quote
are preserved by simply removing the pair of quotes.
In case a matching quote is not found, the launcher will abort with an
error message.
\f[V]\[at]\f[R]-files are supported as they are specified in the command
line.
However, as in \f[V]\[at]\f[R]-files, use of a wildcard is not
supported.
In order to mitigate potential misuse of \f[V]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R]
behavior, options that specify the main class (such as \f[V]-jar\f[R])
or cause the \f[V]java\f[R] launcher to exit without executing the main
class (such as \f[V]-h\f[R]) are disallowed in the environment variable.
If any of these options appear in the environment variable, the launcher
will abort with an error message.
When \f[V]JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS\f[R] is set, the launcher prints a message to
stderr as a reminder.
.PP
\f[B]Example:\f[R]
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
$ export JDK_JAVA_OPTIONS=\[aq]-g \[at]file1 -Dprop=value \[at]file2 -Dws.prop=\[dq]white spaces\[dq]\[aq]
$ java -Xint \[at]file3
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
is equivalent to the command line:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
java -g \[at]file1 -Dprop=value \[at]file2 -Dws.prop=\[dq]white spaces\[dq] -Xint \[at]file3
\f[R]
.fi
.SH OVERVIEW OF JAVA OPTIONS
.PP
The \f[V]java\f[R] command supports a wide range of options in the
following categories:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Standard Options for Java\f[R]: Options guaranteed to be supported
by all implementations of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
They\[aq]re used for common actions, such as checking the version of the
JRE, setting the class path, enabling verbose output, and so on.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Extra Options for Java\f[R]: General purpose options that are
specific to the Java HotSpot Virtual Machine.
They aren\[aq]t guaranteed to be supported by all JVM implementations,
and are subject to change.
These options start with \f[V]-X\f[R].
.PP
The advanced options aren\[aq]t recommended for casual use.
These are developer options used for tuning specific areas of the Java
HotSpot Virtual Machine operation that often have specific system
requirements and may require privileged access to system configuration
parameters.
Several examples of performance tuning are provided in \f[B]Performance
Tuning Examples\f[R].
These options aren\[aq]t guaranteed to be supported by all JVM
implementations and are subject to change.
Advanced options start with \f[V]-XX\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Advanced Runtime Options for Java\f[R]: Control the runtime
behavior of the Java HotSpot VM.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Advanced JIT Compiler Options for java\f[R]: Control the dynamic
just-in-time (JIT) compilation performed by the Java HotSpot VM.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Advanced Serviceability Options for Java\f[R]: Enable gathering
system information and performing extensive debugging.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Advanced Garbage Collection Options for Java\f[R]: Control how
garbage collection (GC) is performed by the Java HotSpot
.PP
Boolean options are used to either enable a feature that\[aq]s disabled
by default or disable a feature that\[aq]s enabled by default.
Such options don\[aq]t require a parameter.
Boolean \f[V]-XX\f[R] options are enabled using the plus sign
(\f[V]-XX:+\f[R]\f[I]OptionName\f[R]) and disabled using the minus sign
(\f[V]-XX:-\f[R]\f[I]OptionName\f[R]).
.PP
For options that require an argument, the argument may be separated from
the option name by a space, a colon (:), or an equal sign (=), or the
argument may directly follow the option (the exact syntax differs for
each option).
If you\[aq]re expected to specify the size in bytes, then you can use no
suffix, or use the suffix \f[V]k\f[R] or \f[V]K\f[R] for kilobytes (KB),
\f[V]m\f[R] or \f[V]M\f[R] for megabytes (MB), or \f[V]g\f[R] or
\f[V]G\f[R] for gigabytes (GB).
For example, to set the size to 8 GB, you can specify either
\f[V]8g\f[R], \f[V]8192m\f[R], \f[V]8388608k\f[R], or
\f[V]8589934592\f[R] as the argument.
If you are expected to specify the percentage, then use a number from 0
to 1.
For example, specify \f[V]0.25\f[R] for 25%.
.PP
The following sections describe the options that are deprecated,
obsolete, and removed:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Deprecated Java Options\f[R]: Accepted and acted upon --- a warning
is issued when they\[aq]re used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Obsolete Java Options\f[R]: Accepted but ignored --- a warning is
issued when they\[aq]re used.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Removed Java Options\f[R]: Removed --- using them results in an
error.
.SH STANDARD OPTIONS FOR JAVA
.PP
These are the most commonly used options supported by all
implementations of the JVM.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] To specify an argument for a long option, you can use
either \f[V]--\f[R]\f[I]name\f[R]\f[V]=\f[R]\f[I]value\f[R] or
\f[V]--\f[R]\f[I]name\f[R] \f[I]value\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[V]-agentlib:\f[R]\f[I]libname\f[R][\f[V]=\f[R]\f[I]options\f[R]]
Loads the specified native agent library.
After the library name, a comma-separated list of options specific to
the library can be used.
If the option \f[V]-agentlib:foo\f[R] is specified, then the JVM
attempts to load the library named \f[V]foo\f[R] using the platform
specific naming conventions and locations:
.RS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]Linux and other POSIX-like platforms:\f[R] The JVM attempts to load
the library named \f[V]libfoo.so\f[R] in the location specified by the
\f[V]LD_LIBRARY_PATH\f[R] system variable.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]macOS:\f[R] The JVM attempts to load the library named
\f[V]libfoo.dylib\f[R] in the location specified by the
\f[V]DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH\f[R] system variable.

.RE
.RE
.RE
.TP
\f[V]-agentpath:\f[R]\f[I]pathname\f[R][\f[V]=\f[R]\f[I]options\f[R]]
Loads the native agent library specified by the absolute path name.
This option is equivalent to \f[V]-agentlib\f[R] but uses the full path
and file name of the library.
.TP
\f[V]--class-path\f[R] \f[I]classpath\f[R], \f[V]-classpath\f[R] \f[I]classpath\f[R], or \f[V]-cp\f[R] \f[I]classpath\f[R]
Specifies a list of directories, JAR files, and ZIP archives to search
for class files.
.RS
.PP
On Windows, semicolons (\f[V];\f[R]) separate entities in this list; on
other platforms it is a colon (\f[V]:\f[R]).
.PP
Specifying \f[I]classpath\f[R] overrides any setting of the
\f[V]CLASSPATH\f[R] environment variable.
If the class path option isn\[aq]t used and \f[I]classpath\f[R]
isn\[aq]t set, then the user class path consists of the current
directory (.).
.PP
As a special convenience, a class path element that contains a base name
of an asterisk (*) is considered equivalent to specifying a list of all
the files in the directory with the extension \f[V].jar\f[R] or
\f[V].JAR\f[R] .
A Java program can\[aq]t tell the difference between the two
invocations.
For example, if the directory mydir contains \f[V]a.jar\f[R] and
\f[V]b.JAR\f[R], then the class path element mydir/* is expanded to
\f[V]A.jar:b.JAR\f[R], except that the order of JAR files is
unspecified.
All \f[V].jar\f[R] files in the specified directory, even hidden ones,
are included in the list.
A class path entry consisting of an asterisk (*) expands to a list of
all the jar files in the current directory.
The \f[V]CLASSPATH\f[R] environment variable, where defined, is
similarly expanded.
Any class path wildcard expansion that occurs before the Java VM is
started.
Java programs never see wildcards that aren\[aq]t expanded except by
querying the environment, such as by calling
\f[V]System.getenv(\[dq]CLASSPATH\[dq])\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[V]--disable-\[at]files\f[R]
Can be used anywhere on the command line, including in an argument file,
to prevent further \f[V]\[at]filename\f[R] expansion.
This option stops expanding \f[V]\[at]\f[R]-argfiles after the option.
.TP
\f[V]--enable-preview\f[R]
Allows classes to depend on \f[B]preview features\f[R]
[https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/12/language/index.html#JSLAN-GUID-5A82FE0E-0CA4-4F1F-B075-564874FE2823]
of the release.
.TP
\f[V]--finalization=\f[R]\f[I]value\f[R]
Controls whether the JVM performs finalization of objects.
Valid values are \[dq]enabled\[dq] and \[dq]disabled\[dq].
Finalization is enabled by default, so the value \[dq]enabled\[dq] does
nothing.
The value \[dq]disabled\[dq] disables finalization, so that no
finalizers are invoked.
.TP
\f[V]--module-path\f[R] \f[I]modulepath\f[R]... or \f[V]-p\f[R] \f[I]modulepath\f[R]
Specifies a list of directories in which each directory is a directory

\f[V]G\f[R] to indicate gigabytes.
The young generation region of the heap is used for new objects.
GC is performed in this region more often than in other regions.
If the size for the young generation is too small, then a lot of minor
garbage collections are performed.
If the size is too large, then only full garbage collections are
performed, which can take a long time to complete.
It is recommended that you do not set the size for the young generation
for the G1 collector, and keep the size for the young generation greater

collectors.

\f[V]-XX:AllocateHeapAt=\f[R]\f[I]path\f[R]
Takes a path to the file system and uses memory mapping to allocate the
object heap on the memory device.
Using this option enables the HotSpot VM to allocate the Java object
heap on an alternative memory device, such as an NV-DIMM, specified by
the user.
.RS

Alternative memory devices that have the same semantics as DRAM,
including the semantics of atomic operations, can be used instead of
DRAM for the object heap without changing the existing application code.
All other memory structures (such as the code heap, metaspace, and
thread stacks) continue to reside in DRAM.
.PP
Some operating systems expose non-DRAM memory through the file system.
Memory-mapped files in these file systems bypass the page cache and
provide a direct mapping of virtual memory to the physical memory on the
device.

\f[V]-Xms\f[R]) and garbage-collection related flags continue to work as

\f[V]-XX:-CompactStrings\f[R]
Disables the Compact Strings feature.
By default, this option is enabled.
When this option is enabled, Java Strings containing only single-byte
characters are internally represented and stored as
single-byte-per-character Strings using ISO-8859-1 / Latin-1 encoding.
This reduces, by 50%, the amount of space required for Strings
containing only single-byte characters.
For Java Strings containing at least one multibyte character: these are
represented and stored as 2 bytes per character using UTF-16 encoding.
Disabling the Compact Strings feature forces the use of UTF-16 encoding
as the internal representation for all Java Strings.
.RS
.PP
Cases where it may be beneficial to disable Compact Strings include the
following:
.IP \[bu] 2
When it\[aq]s known that an application overwhelmingly will be
allocating multibyte character Strings
.IP \[bu] 2

If the method is specified without the signature, then the command is
applied to all methods with the specified name.
However, you can also specify the signature of the method in the class

In this case, you should enclose the arguments in quotation marks,
because otherwise the shell treats the semicolon as a command end.
For example, if you want to exclude only the \f[V]indexOf(String)\f[R]

Options related to RTM are available only on x86 CPUs that support
Transactional Synchronization Extensions (TSX).
.RS
.PP
RTM is part of Intel\[aq]s TSX, which is an x86 instruction set
extension and facilitates the creation of multithreaded applications.
RTM introduces the new instructions \f[V]XBEGIN\f[R], \f[V]XABORT\f[R],
\f[V]XEND\f[R], and \f[V]XTEST\f[R].
The \f[V]XBEGIN\f[R] and \f[V]XEND\f[R] instructions enclose a set of
instructions to run as a transaction.
If no conflict is found when running the transaction, then the memory
and register modifications are committed together at the \f[V]XEND\f[R]
instruction.
The \f[V]XABORT\f[R] instruction can be used to explicitly abort a
transaction and the \f[V]XTEST\f[R] instruction checks if a set of
instructions is being run in a transaction.
.PP
A lock on a transaction is inflated when another thread tries to access
the same transaction, thereby blocking the thread that didn\[aq]t
originally request access to the transaction.
RTM requires that a fallback set of operations be specified in case a
transaction aborts or fails.
An RTM lock is a lock that has been delegated to the TSX\[aq]s system.
.PP
RTM improves performance for highly contended locks with low conflict in
a critical region (which is code that must not be accessed by more than
one thread concurrently).
RTM also improves the performance of coarse-grain locking, which
typically doesn\[aq]t perform well in multithreaded applications.
(Coarse-grain locking is the strategy of holding locks for long periods
to minimize the overhead of taking and releasing locks, while
fine-grained locking is the strategy of trying to achieve maximum
parallelism by locking only when necessary and unlocking as soon as
possible.)
Also, for lightly contended locks that are used by different threads,
RTM can reduce false cache line sharing, also known as cache line
ping-pong.
This occurs when multiple threads from different processors are
accessing different resources, but the resources share the same cache
line.
As a result, the processors repeatedly invalidate the cache lines of
other processors, which forces them to read from main memory instead of
their cache.

Enables the use of thread-local allocation blocks (TLABs) in the young
generation space.
This option is enabled by default.
To disable the use of TLABs, specify the option \f[V]-XX:-UseTLAB\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]-XX:+UseZGC\f[R]
Enables the use of the Z garbage collector (ZGC).
This is a low latency garbage collector, providing max pause times of a
few milliseconds, at some throughput cost.
Pause times are independent of what heap size is used.
Supports heap sizes from 8MB to 16TB.
.TP
\f[V]-XX:ZAllocationSpikeTolerance=\f[R]\f[I]factor\f[R]
Sets the allocation spike tolerance for ZGC.
By default, this option is set to 2.0.
This factor describes the level of allocation spikes to expect.
For example, using a factor of 3.0 means the current allocation rate can
be expected to triple at any time.
.TP
\f[V]-XX:ZCollectionInterval=\f[R]\f[I]seconds\f[R]
Sets the maximum interval (in seconds) between two GC cycles when using
ZGC.
By default, this option is set to 0 (disabled).
.TP
\f[V]-XX:ZFragmentationLimit=\f[R]\f[I]percent\f[R]
Sets the maximum acceptable heap fragmentation (in percent) for ZGC.
By default, this option is set to 25.
Using a lower value will cause the heap to be compacted more
aggressively, to reclaim more memory at the cost of using more CPU time.
.TP
\f[V]-XX:+ZProactive\f[R]
Enables proactive GC cycles when using ZGC.
By default, this option is enabled.
ZGC will start a proactive GC cycle if doing so is expected to have
minimal impact on the running application.
This is useful if the application is mostly idle or allocates very few
objects, but you still want to keep the heap size down and allow
reference processing to happen even when there are a lot of free space
on the heap.
.TP
\f[V]-XX:+ZUncommit\f[R]
Enables uncommitting of unused heap memory when using ZGC.
By default, this option is enabled.
Uncommitting unused heap memory will lower the memory footprint of the
JVM, and make that memory available for other processes to use.
.TP
\f[V]-XX:ZUncommitDelay=\f[R]\f[I]seconds\f[R]
Sets the amount of time (in seconds) that heap memory must have been
unused before being uncommitted.
By default, this option is set to 300 (5 minutes).
Committing and uncommitting memory are relatively expensive operations.
Using a lower value will cause heap memory to be uncommitted earlier, at
the risk of soon having to commit it again.
.SH DEPRECATED JAVA OPTIONS

given with the same java command.
\f[V]-Xloggc:\f[R]\f[I]filename\f[R] is replaced by

.SH JAVA COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENT FILES
.PP
You can shorten or simplify the \f[V]java\f[R] command by using
\f[V]\[at]\f[R] argument files to specify one or more text files that
contain arguments, such as options and class names, which are passed to
the \f[V]java\f[R] command.
This let\[aq]s you to create \f[V]java\f[R] commands of any length on
any operating system.
.PP
In the command line, use the at sign (\f[V]\[at]\f[R]) prefix to
identify an argument file that contains \f[V]java\f[R] options and class
names.
When the \f[V]java\f[R] command encounters a file beginning with the at
sign (\f[V]\[at]\f[R]), it expands the contents of that file into an
argument list just as they would be specified on the command line.
.PP
The \f[V]java\f[R] launcher expands the argument file contents until it
encounters the \f[V]--disable-\[at]files\f[R] option.
You can use the \f[V]--disable-\[at]files\f[R] option anywhere on the
command line, including in an argument file, to stop \f[V]\[at]\f[R]
argument files expansion.
.PP
The following items describe the syntax of \f[V]java\f[R] argument
files:
.IP \[bu] 2
The argument file must contain only ASCII characters or characters in
system default encoding that\[aq]s ASCII friendly, such as UTF-8.
.IP \[bu] 2
The argument file size must not exceed MAXINT (2,147,483,647) bytes.
.IP \[bu] 2
The launcher doesn\[aq]t expand wildcards that are present within an
argument file.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use white space or new line characters to separate arguments included in
the file.
.IP \[bu] 2
White space includes a white space character, \f[V]\[rs]t\f[R],
\f[V]\[rs]n\f[R], \f[V]\[rs]r\f[R], and \f[V]\[rs]f\f[R].
.RS 2
.PP
For example, it is possible to have a path with a space, such as
\f[V]c:\[rs]Program Files\f[R] that can be specified as either
\f[V]\[dq]c:\[rs]\[rs]Program Files\[dq]\f[R] or, to avoid an escape,
\f[V]c:\[rs]Program\[dq] \[dq]Files\f[R].
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
Any option that contains spaces, such as a path component, must be
within quotation marks using quotation (\[aq]\[dq]\[aq]) characters in
its entirety.
.IP \[bu] 2
A string within quotation marks may contain the characters
\f[V]\[rs]n\f[R], \f[V]\[rs]r\f[R], \f[V]\[rs]t\f[R], and
\f[V]\[rs]f\f[R].
They are converted to their respective ASCII codes.
.IP \[bu] 2
If a file name contains embedded spaces, then put the whole file name in
double quotation marks.
.IP \[bu] 2
File names in an argument file are relative to the current directory,
not to the location of the argument file.
.IP \[bu] 2
Use the number sign \f[V]#\f[R] in the argument file to identify
comments.
All characters following the \f[V]#\f[R] are ignored until the end of
line.
.IP \[bu] 2
Additional at sign \f[V]\[at]\f[R] prefixes to \f[V]\[at]\f[R] prefixed
options act as an escape, (the first \f[V]\[at]\f[R] is removed and the
rest of the arguments are presented to the launcher literally).
.IP \[bu] 2
Lines may be continued using the continuation character
(\f[V]\[rs]\f[R]) at the end-of-line.
The two lines are concatenated with the leading white spaces trimmed.
To prevent trimming the leading white spaces, a continuation character
(\f[V]\[rs]\f[R]) may be placed at the first column.
.IP \[bu] 2
Because backslash (\[rs]) is an escape character, a backslash character
must be escaped with another backslash character.
.IP \[bu] 2
Partial quote is allowed and is closed by an end-of-file.
.IP \[bu] 2
An open quote stops at end-of-line unless \f[V]\[rs]\f[R] is the last
character, which then joins the next line by removing all leading white
space characters.
.IP \[bu] 2
Wildcards (*) aren\[aq]t allowed in these lists (such as specifying
\f[V]*.java\f[R]).
.IP \[bu] 2
Use of the at sign (\f[V]\[at]\f[R]) to recursively interpret files
isn\[aq]t supported.

.SH CODE HEAP STATE ANALYTICS
.SS Overview
.PP
There are occasions when having insight into the current state of the
JVM code heap would be helpful to answer questions such as:
.IP \[bu] 2
Why was the JIT turned off and then on again and again?
.IP \[bu] 2
Where has all the code heap space gone?
.IP \[bu] 2
Why is the method sweeper not working effectively?
.PP
To provide this insight, a code heap state analytics feature has been
implemented that enables on-the-fly analysis of the code heap.
The analytics process is divided into two parts.
The first part examines the entire code heap and aggregates all
information that is believed to be useful or important.
The second part consists of several independent steps that print the
collected information with an emphasis on different aspects of the data.
Data collection and printing are done on an \[dq]on request\[dq] basis.

characters with the sequence \f[V]\[aq]\[rs]\[aq]\f[R] and
\f[V]\[aq]n\[aq]\f[R] in the output.
Existing single backslash characters will also be replaced with a
sequence of two backslashes so that the conversion can be reversed.
This option is safe to use with UTF-8 character encodings, but other
encodings may not work.
For example, it may incorrectly convert multi-byte sequences in Shift
JIS and BIG5.

.SS Default Configuration
.PP
When the \f[V]-Xlog\f[R] option and nothing else is specified on the

The default configuration logs all messages with a level that matches
either warning or error regardless of what tags the message is
associated with.

.RE
.SS Controlling Logging at Runtime
.PP
Logging can also be controlled at run time through Diagnostic Commands
(with the \f[B]jcmd\f[R] utility).
Everything that can be specified on the command line can also be
specified dynamically with the \f[V]VM.log\f[R] command.
As the diagnostic commands are automatically exposed as MBeans, you can
use JMX to change logging configuration at run time.
.SS -Xlog Tags and Levels
.PP
Each log message has a level and a tag set associated with it.
The level of the message corresponds to its details, and the tag set
corresponds to what the message contains or which JVM component it
involves (such as, \f[V]gc\f[R], \f[V]jit\f[R], or \f[V]os\f[R]).
Mapping GC flags to the Xlog configuration is described in \f[B]Convert

\f[V]stderr\f[R] --- Sends output to stderr
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]file=\f[R]\f[I]filename\f[R] --- Sends output to text file(s).
.PP
When using \f[V]file=\f[R]\f[I]filename\f[R], specifying \f[V]%p\f[R]
and/or \f[V]%t\f[R] in the file name expands to the JVM\[aq]s PID and
startup timestamp, respectively.
You can also configure text files to handle file rotation based on file
size and a number of files to rotate.
For example, to rotate the log file every 10 MB and keep 5 files in
rotation, specify the options \f[V]filesize=10M, filecount=5\f[R].
The target size of the files isn\[aq]t guaranteed to be exact, it\[aq]s
just an approximate value.
Files are rotated by default with up to 5 rotated files of target size
20 MB, unless configured otherwise.
Specifying \f[V]filecount=0\f[R] means that the log file shouldn\[aq]t
be rotated.
There\[aq]s a possibility of the pre-existing log file getting
overwritten.
.SS -Xlog Output Mode
.PP
By default logging messages are output synchronously - each log message
is written to the designated output when the logging call is made.
But you can instead use asynchronous logging mode by specifying:
.TP
\f[V]-Xlog:async\f[R]
Write all logging asynchronously.
.PP
In asynchronous logging mode, log sites enqueue all logging messages to
an intermediate buffer and a standalone thread is responsible for
flushing them to the corresponding outputs.
The intermediate buffer is bounded and on buffer exhaustion the
enqueuing message is discarded.
Log entry write operations are guaranteed non-blocking.
.PP
The option \f[V]-XX:AsyncLogBufferSize=N\f[R] specifies the memory
budget in bytes for the intermediate buffer.
The default value should be big enough to cater for most cases.
Users can provide a custom value to trade memory overhead for log
accuracy if they need to.
.SS Decorations
.PP
Logging messages are decorated with information about the message.
You can configure each output to use a custom set of decorators.
The order of the output is always the same as listed in the table.
You can configure the decorations to be used at run time.
Decorations are prepended to the log message.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
[6.567s][info][gc,old] Old collection complete
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
Omitting \f[V]decorators\f[R] defaults to \f[V]uptime\f[R],
\f[V]level\f[R], and \f[V]tags\f[R].
The \f[V]none\f[R] decorator is special and is used to turn off all
decorations.
.PP
\f[V]time\f[R] (\f[V]t\f[R]), \f[V]utctime\f[R] (\f[V]utc\f[R]),
\f[V]uptime\f[R] (\f[V]u\f[R]), \f[V]timemillis\f[R] (\f[V]tm\f[R]),
\f[V]uptimemillis\f[R] (\f[V]um\f[R]), \f[V]timenanos\f[R]
(\f[V]tn\f[R]), \f[V]uptimenanos\f[R] (\f[V]un\f[R]), \f[V]hostname\f[R]
(\f[V]hn\f[R]), \f[V]pid\f[R] (\f[V]p\f[R]), \f[V]tid\f[R]
(\f[V]ti\f[R]), \f[V]level\f[R] (\f[V]l\f[R]), \f[V]tags\f[R]
(\f[V]tg\f[R]) decorators can also be specified as \f[V]none\f[R] for no
decoration.

.SH VALIDATE JAVA VIRTUAL MACHINE FLAG ARGUMENTS
.PP
You use values provided to all Java Virtual Machine (JVM) command-line
flags for validation and, if the input value is invalid or out-of-range,
then an appropriate error message is displayed.
.PP
Whether they\[aq]re set ergonomically, in a command line, by an input
tool, or through the APIs (for example, classes contained in the package
\f[V]java.lang.management\f[R]) the values provided to all Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) command-line flags are validated.
Ergonomics are described in Java Platform, Standard Edition HotSpot
Virtual Machine Garbage Collection Tuning Guide.
.PP
Range and constraints are validated either when all flags have their
values set during JVM initialization or a flag\[aq]s value is changed
during runtime (for example using the \f[V]jcmd\f[R] tool).
The JVM is terminated if a value violates either the range or constraint
check and an appropriate error message is printed on the error stream.
.PP
For example, if a flag violates a range or a constraint check, then the
JVM exits with an error:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
java -XX:AllocatePrefetchStyle=5 -version
intx AllocatePrefetchStyle=5 is outside the allowed range [ 0 ... 3 ]
Improperly specified VM option \[aq]AllocatePrefetchStyle=5\[aq]
Error: Could not create the Java Virtual Machine.
Error: A fatal exception has occurred. Program will exit.
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The flag \f[V]-XX:+PrintFlagsRanges\f[R] prints the range of all the
flags.
This flag allows automatic testing of the flags by the values provided
by the ranges.
For the flags that have the ranges specified, the type, name, and the
actual range is printed in the output.
.PP
For example,
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
intx   ThreadStackSize [ 0 ... 9007199254740987 ] {pd product}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
For the flags that don\[aq]t have the range specified, the values
aren\[aq]t displayed in the print out.
For example:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
size_t NewSize         [   ...                  ] {product}
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
This helps to identify the flags that need to be implemented.
The automatic testing framework can skip those flags that don\[aq]t have
values and aren\[aq]t implemented.
.SH LARGE PAGES
.PP
You use large pages, also known as huge pages, as memory pages that are
significantly larger than the standard memory page size (which varies
depending on the processor and operating system).
Large pages optimize processor Translation-Lookaside Buffers.
.PP
A Translation-Lookaside Buffer (TLB) is a page translation cache that
holds the most-recently used virtual-to-physical address translations.
A TLB is a scarce system resource.
A TLB miss can be costly because the processor must then read from the
hierarchical page table, which may require multiple memory accesses.
By using a larger memory page size, a single TLB entry can represent a
larger memory range.
This results in less pressure on a TLB, and memory-intensive
applications may have better performance.
.PP
However, using large pages can negatively affect system performance.
For example, when a large amount of memory is pinned by an application,
it may create a shortage of regular memory and cause excessive paging in
other applications and slow down the entire system.
Also, a system that has been up for a long time could produce excessive
fragmentation, which could make it impossible to reserve enough large
page memory.
When this happens, either the OS or JVM reverts to using regular pages.
.PP
Linux and Windows support large pages.
.SS Large Pages Support for Linux
.PP
Linux supports large pages since version 2.6.
To check if your environment supports large pages, try the following:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
# cat /proc/meminfo | grep Huge
HugePages_Total: 0
HugePages_Free: 0
\&...
Hugepagesize: 2048 kB
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
If the output contains items prefixed with \[dq]Huge\[dq], then your
system supports large pages.
The values may vary depending on environment.
The \f[V]Hugepagesize\f[R] field shows the default large page size in
your environment, and the other fields show details for large pages of
this size.
Newer kernels have support for multiple large page sizes.
To list the supported page sizes, run this:
.IP
.nf
\f[CB]
# ls /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/
hugepages-1048576kB  hugepages-2048kB
\f[R]
.fi
.PP
The above environment supports 2 MB and 1 GB large pages, but they need
to be configured so that the JVM can use them.
When using large pages and not enabling transparent huge pages (option
\f[V]-XX:+UseTransparentHugePages\f[R]), the number of large pages must
be pre-allocated.
For example, to enable 8 GB of memory to be backed by 2 MB large pages,
login as \f[V]root\f[R] and run:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]# echo 4096 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages\f[R]
.RE
.PP
It is always recommended to check the value of \f[V]nr_hugepages\f[R]
after the request to make sure the kernel was able to allocate the
requested number of large pages.
.PP
When using the option \f[V]-XX:+UseSHM\f[R] to enable large pages you
also need to make sure the \f[V]SHMMAX\f[R] parameter is configured to
allow large enough shared memory segments to be allocated.
To allow a maximum shared segment of 8 GB, login as \f[V]root\f[R] and
run:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]# echo 8589934592 > /proc/sys/kernel/shmmax\f[R]
.RE
.PP
In some environments this is not needed since the default value is large
enough, but it is important to make sure the value is large enough to
fit the amount of memory intended to be backed by large pages.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R] The values contained in \f[V]/proc\f[R] and
\f[V]/sys\f[R] reset after you reboot your system, so may want to set
them in an initialization script (for example, \f[V]rc.local\f[R] or
\f[V]sysctl.conf\f[R]).
.RE
.PP
If you configure the OS kernel parameters to enable use of large pages,
the Java processes may allocate large pages for the Java heap as well as
other internal areas, for example:
.IP \[bu] 2
Code cache
.IP \[bu] 2
Marking bitmaps
.PP
Consequently, if you configure the \f[V]nr_hugepages\f[R] parameter to
the size of the Java heap, then the JVM can still fail to allocate the
heap using large pages because other areas such as the code cache might
already have used some of the configured large pages.
.SS Large Pages Support for Windows
.PP
To use large pages support on Windows, the administrator must first
assign additional privileges to the user who is running the application:
.IP "1." 3
Select \f[B]Control Panel\f[R], \f[B]Administrative Tools\f[R], and then
\f[B]Local Security Policy\f[R].
.IP "2." 3
Select \f[B]Local Policies\f[R] and then \f[B]User Rights
Assignment\f[R].
.IP "3." 3
Double-click \f[B]Lock pages in memory\f[R], then add users and/or
groups.
.IP "4." 3
Reboot your system.
.PP
Note that these steps are required even if it\[aq]s the administrator
who\[aq]s running the application, because administrators by default
don\[aq]t have the privilege to lock pages in memory.
.SH APPLICATION CLASS DATA SHARING
.PP
Application Class Data Sharing (AppCDS) stores classes used by your
applications in an archive file.
Since these classes are stored in a format that can be loaded very
quickly (compared to classes stored in a JAR file), AppCDS can improve
the start-up time of your applications.
In addition, AppCDS can reduce the runtime memory footprint by sharing
parts of these classes across multiple processes.
.PP
Classes in the CDS archive are stored in an optimized format that\[aq]s
about 2 to 5 times larger than classes stored in JAR files or the JDK
runtime image.
Therefore, it\[aq]s a good idea to archive only those classes that are
actually used by your application.
These usually are just a small portion of all available classes.
For example, your application may use only a few APIs provided by a
large library.
.SS Using CDS Archives
.PP
By default, in most JDK distributions, unless \f[V]-Xshare:off\f[R] is
specified, the JVM starts up with a default CDS archive, which is
usually located in \f[V]JAVA_HOME/lib/server/classes.jsa\f[R] (or
\f[V]JAVA_HOME\[rs]bin\[rs]server\[rs]classes.jsa\f[R] on Windows).
This archive contains about 1300 core library classes that are used by
most applications.
.PP
To use CDS for the exact set of classes used by your application, you
can use the \f[V]-XX:SharedArchiveFile\f[R] option, which has the
general form:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]-XX:SharedArchiveFile=<static_archive>:<dynamic_archive>\f[R]
.RE
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[V]<static_archive>\f[R] overrides the default CDS archive.
.IP \[bu] 2
The \f[V]<dynamic_archive>\f[R] provides additional classes that can be
loaded on top of those in the \f[V]<static_archive>\f[R].
.IP \[bu] 2
On Windows, the above path delimiter \f[V]:\f[R] should be replaced with
\f[V];\f[R]
.PP
(The names \[dq]static\[dq] and \[dq]dynamic\[dq] are used for
historical reasons.
The only significance is that the \[dq]static\[dq] archive is loaded
first and the \[dq]dynamic\[dq] archive is loaded second).
.PP
The JVM can use up to two archives.
To use only a single \f[V]<static_archive>\f[R], you can omit the
\f[V]<dynamic_archive>\f[R] portion:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]-XX:SharedArchiveFile=<static_archive>\f[R]
.RE
.PP
For convenience, the \f[V]<dynamic_archive>\f[R] records the location of
the \f[V]<static_archive>\f[R].
Therefore, you can omit the \f[V]<static_archive>\f[R] by saying only:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]-XX:SharedArchiveFile=<dynamic_archive>\f[R]
.RE
.SS Manually Creating CDS Archives
.PP
CDS archives can be created manually using several methods:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]-Xshare:dump\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]-XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit\f[R]
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]jcmd VM.cds\f[R]
.PP
One common operation in all these methods is a \[dq]trial run\[dq],
where you run the application once to determine the classes that should
be stored in the archive.
.SS Creating a Static CDS Archive File with -Xshare:dump
.PP
The following steps create a static CDS archive file that contains all
the classes used by the \f[V]test.Hello\f[R] application.
.IP "1." 3
Create a list of all classes used by the \f[V]test.Hello\f[R]
application.
The following command creates a file named \f[V]hello.classlist\f[R]
that contains a list of all classes used by this application:
.RS 4
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -Xshare:off -XX:DumpLoadedClassList=hello.classlist -cp hello.jar test.Hello\f[R]
.RE
.PP
The classpath specified by the \f[V]-cp\f[R] parameter must contain only
JAR files.
.RE
.IP "2." 3
Create a static archive, named \f[V]hello.jsa\f[R], that contains all
the classes in \f[V]hello.classlist\f[R]:
.RS 4
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -Xshare:dump -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -XX:SharedClassListFile=hello.classlist -cp hello.jar\f[R]
.RE

\f[V]java -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar test.Hello\f[R]
.RE

.IP "4." 3
\f[B]Optional\f[R] Verify that the \f[V]test.Hello\f[R] application is

.RS 4
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar -Xlog:class+load test.Hello\f[R]
.RE
.PP
The output of this command should contain the following text:
.RS
.PP
\f[V][info][class,load] test.Hello source: shared objects file\f[R]
.RE
.RE
.SS Creating a Dynamic CDS Archive File with -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit
.PP
Advantages of dynamic CDS archives are:
.IP \[bu] 2
They usually use less disk space, since they don\[aq]t need to store the
classes that are already in the static archive.
.IP \[bu] 2
They are created with one fewer step than the comparable static archive.
.PP
The following steps create a dynamic CDS archive file that contains the
classes that are used by the \f[V]test.Hello\f[R] application, excluding
those that are already in the default CDS archive.
.IP "1." 3
Create a dynamic CDS archive, named \f[V]hello.jsa\f[R], that contains
all the classes in \f[V]hello.jar\f[R] loaded by the application
\f[V]test.Hello\f[R]:
.RS 4
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar Hello\f[R]
.RE
.RE
.IP "2." 3
Run the application \f[V]test.Hello\f[R] with the shared archive
\f[V]hello.jsa\f[R]:
.RS 4
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar test.Hello\f[R]
.RE
.RE
.IP "3." 3
\f[B]Optional\f[R] Repeat step 4 of the previous section to verify that
the \f[V]test.Hello\f[R] application is using the class contained in the
\f[V]hello.jsa\f[R] shared archive.
.PP
It\[aq]s also possible to create a dynamic CDS archive with a
non-default static CDS archive.
E.g.,
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:SharedArchiveFile=base.jsa -XX:ArchiveClassesAtExit=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar Hello\f[R]
.RE
.PP
To run the application using this dynamic CDS archive:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:SharedArchiveFile=base.jsa:hello.jsa -cp hello.jar Hello\f[R]
.RE
.PP
(On Windows, the above path delimiter \f[V]:\f[R] should be replaced
with \f[V];\f[R])
.PP
As mention above, the name of the static archive can be skipped:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar Hello\f[R]
.RE
.SS Creating CDS Archive Files with jcmd
.PP
The previous two sections require you to modify the application\[aq]s
start-up script in order to create a CDS archive.
Sometimes this could be difficult, for example, if the application\[aq]s
class path is set up by complex routines.
.PP
The \f[V]jcmd VM.cds\f[R] command provides a less intrusive way for
creating a CDS archive by connecting to a running JVM process.
You can create either a static:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]jcmd <pid> VM.cds static_dump my_static_archive.jsa\f[R]
.RE
.PP
or a dynamic archive:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]jcmd <pid> VM.cds dynamic_dump my_dynamic_archive.jsa\f[R]
.RE
.PP
To use the resulting archive file in a subsequent run of the application
without modifying the application\[aq]s start-up script, you can use the
following technique:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]env JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-XX:SharedArchiveFile=my_static_archive.jsa bash app_start.sh\f[R]
.RE
.PP
Note: to use \f[V]jcmd <pid> VM.cds dynamic_dump\f[R], the JVM process
identified by \f[V]<pid>\f[R] must be started with
\f[V]-XX:+RecordDynamicDumpInfo\f[R], which can also be passed to the
application start-up script with the same technique:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]env JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-XX:+RecordDynamicDumpInfo bash app_start.sh\f[R]
.RE
.SS Creating Dynamic CDS Archive File with -XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive
.PP
\f[V]-XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive\f[R] is a more convenient way of
creating/using CDS archives.
Unlike the methods of manual CDS archive creation described in the
previous section, with \f[V]-XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive\f[R], it\[aq]s
no longer necessary to have a separate trial run.
Instead, you can always run the application with the same command-line
and enjoy the benefits of CDS automatically.
.RS
.PP
\f[V]java -XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive -XX:SharedArchiveFile=hello.jsa -cp hello.jar Hello\f[R]
.RE
.PP
If the specified archive file exists and was created by the same version
of the JDK, then it will be loaded as a dynamic archive; otherwise it is
ignored at VM startup.
.PP
At VM exit, if the specified archive file does not exist, it will be
created.
If it exists but was created with a different (but post JDK 19) version
of the JDK, then it will be replaced.
In both cases the archive will be ready to be loaded the next time the
JVM is launched with the same command line.
.PP
If the specified archive file exists but was created by a JDK version
prior to JDK 19, then it will be ignored: neither loaded at startup, nor
replaced at exit.
.PP
Developers should note that the contents of the CDS archive file are
specific to each build of the JDK.
Therefore, if you switch to a different JDK build,
\f[V]-XX:+AutoCreateSharedArchive\f[R] will automatically recreate the
archive to match the JDK.
If you intend to use this feature with an existing archive, you should
make sure that the archive is created by at least version 19 of the JDK.
.SS Restrictions on Class Path and Module Path
.IP \[bu] 2
Neither the class path (\f[V]-classpath\f[R] and
\f[V]-Xbootclasspath/a\f[R]) nor the module path
(\f[V]--module-path\f[R]) can contain non-empty directories.
.IP \[bu] 2
Only modular JAR files are supported in \f[V]--module-path\f[R].
Exploded modules are not supported.
.IP \[bu] 2
The class path used at archive creation time must be the same as (or a
prefix of) the class path used at run time.
(There\[aq]s no such requirement for the module path.)
.IP \[bu] 2
The CDS archive cannot be loaded if any JAR files in the class path or
module path are modified after the archive is generated.
.IP \[bu] 2
If any of the VM options \f[V]--upgrade-module-path\f[R],
\f[V]--patch-module\f[R] or \f[V]--limit-modules\f[R] are specified, CDS
is disabled.
This means that the JVM will execute without loading any CDS archives.
In addition, if you try to create a CDS archive with any of these 3
options specified, the JVM will report an error.
.SH PERFORMANCE TUNING EXAMPLES

.RE
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
The following exit values are typically returned by the launcher when
the launcher is called with the wrong arguments, serious errors, or
exceptions thrown by the JVM.
However, a Java application may choose to return any value by using the

The values are:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]0\f[R]: Successful completion
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]>0\f[R]: An error occurred
