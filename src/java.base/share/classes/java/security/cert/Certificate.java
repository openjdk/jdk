/**
 * <p>Abstract class for managing a variety of identity certificates.
 * An identity certificate is a binding of a principal to a public key which
 * is vouched for by another principal.  (A principal represents
 * an entity such as an individual user, a group, or a corporation.)
 * <p>
 * This class is an abstraction for certificates that have different
 * formats but important common uses.  For example, different types of
 * certificates, such as X.509 and PGP, share general certificate
 * functionality (like encoding and verifying) and
 * some types of information (like a public key).
 * <p>
 * X.509, PGP, and SDSI certificates can all be implemented by
 * subclassing the Certificate class, even though they contain different
 * sets of information, and they store and retrieve the information in
 * different ways.
