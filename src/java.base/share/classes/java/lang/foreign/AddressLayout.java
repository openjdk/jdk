/**
 * A value layout used to model the address of some region of memory. The carrier
 * associated with an address layout is {@code MemorySegment.class}. The size and
 * alignment of an address layout are platform-dependent (e.g. on a 64-bit platform,
 * the size and alignment of an address layout are set to 8 bytes).
 * <p>
 * An address layout may optionally feature a {@linkplain #targetLayout() target layout}.
 * An address layout with target layout {@code T} can be used to model the address of a
 * region of memory whose layout is {@code T}. For instance, an address layout with
 * target layout {@link ValueLayout#JAVA_INT} can be used to model the address of a
 * region of memory that is 4 bytes long. Specifying a target layout can be useful in
 * the following situations:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When accessing a memory segment that has been obtained by reading an address from
 *     another memory segment, e.g. using {@link MemorySegment#getAtIndex(AddressLayout, long)};</li>
 *     <li>When creating a downcall method handle, using {@link Linker#downcallHandle(FunctionDescriptor, Option...)};
 *     <li>When creating an upcall stub, using {@link Linker#upcallStub(MethodHandle, FunctionDescriptor, Arena, Option...)}.
 * </ul>
