/**
 * A memory layout describes the contents of a memory segment.
 * <p>
 * There are two leaves in the layout hierarchy, {@linkplain ValueLayout value layouts},
 * which are used to represent values of given size and kind and
 * {@linkplain PaddingLayout padding layouts} which are used, as the name suggests, to
 * represent a portion of a memory segment whose contents should be ignored, and which
 * are primarily present for alignment reasons. Some common value layout constants, such
 * as {@link ValueLayout#JAVA_INT} and {@link ValueLayout#JAVA_FLOAT_UNALIGNED} are
 * defined in the {@link ValueLayout} class. A special kind of value layout, namely an
 * {@linkplain AddressLayout address layout}, is used to model values that denote the
 * address of a region of memory.
 * <p>
 * More complex layouts can be derived from simpler ones: a
 * {@linkplain SequenceLayout sequence layout} denotes a homogeneous repetition of zero
 * or more occurrences of an element layout; a {@linkplain GroupLayout group layout}
 * denotes a heterogeneous aggregation of zero or more member layouts. Group layouts
 * come in two flavors: {@linkplain StructLayout struct layouts}, where member layouts
 * are laid out one after the other, and {@linkplain UnionLayout union layouts} where
 * member layouts are laid out at the same starting offset.
 * <p>
 * Layouts can be optionally associated with a <em>name</em>. A layout name can be
 * referred to when constructing <a href="MemoryLayout.html#layout-paths"><em>layout paths</em></a>.
 * <p>
 * Consider the following struct declaration in C:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=c :
 * typedef struct {
 *     char kind;
 *     int value;
 * } TaggedValues[5];
 * }
 *
 * The above declaration can be modeled using a layout object, as follows:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * SequenceLayout TAGGED_VALUES = MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(5,
 *     MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *         ValueLayout.JAVA_BYTE.withName("kind"),
 *         MemoryLayout.paddingLayout(3),
 *         ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("value")
 *     )
 * ).withName("TaggedValues");
 * }
 *
 * <h2 id="layout-align">Characteristics of memory layouts</h2>
 *
 * All layouts have a <em>size</em> (expressed in bytes), which is defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The size of a value layout is determined by the {@linkplain ValueLayout#carrier()}
 *     associated with the value layout. That is, the constant {@link ValueLayout#JAVA_INT}
 *     has carrier {@code int}, and size of 4 bytes;</li>
 *     <li>The size of an address layout is platform-dependent. That is, the constant
 *     {@link ValueLayout#ADDRESS} has a size of 8 bytes on a 64-bit platform;</li>
 *     <li>The size of a padding layout is always provided explicitly, on
 *     {@linkplain MemoryLayout#paddingLayout(long) construction};</li>
 *     <li>The size of a sequence layout whose element layout is <em>E</em>
 *     and element count is <em>L</em>, is the size of <em>E</em>,
 *     multiplied by <em>L</em>;</li>
 *     <li>The size of a struct layout with member layouts <em>M1</em>, <em>M2</em>, ... <em>Mn</em>
 *     whose sizes are <em>S1</em>, <em>S2</em>, ... <em>Sn</em>, respectively,
 *     is <em>S1 + S2 + ... + Sn</em>;</li>
 *     <li>The size of a union layout <em>U</em> with member layouts
 *     <em>M1</em>, <em>M2</em>, ... <em>Mn</em> whose sizes are
 *     <em>S1</em>, <em>S2</em>, ... <em>Sn</em>, respectively, is <em>max(S1, S2, ... Sn).</em></li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Furthermore, all layouts have a <em>natural alignment</em> (expressed in bytes) which
 * is defined as follows:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>The natural alignment of a padding layout is 1;</li>
 *     <li>The natural alignment of a value layout whose size is <em>N</em> is
 *     <em>N</em>;</li>
 *     <li>The natural alignment of a sequence layout whose element layout is
 *     <em>E</em> is the alignment of <em>E</em>;</li>
 *     <li>The natural alignment of a group layout with member layouts
 *     <em>M1</em>, <em>M2</em>, ... <em>Mn</em> whose alignments are
 *     <em>A1</em>, <em>A2</em>, ... <em>An</em>, respectively, is <em>max(A1, A2 ... An)</em>.</li>
 * </ul>
 * A layout's alignment can be overridden if needed
 * (see {@link MemoryLayout#withByteAlignment(long)}), which can be useful to describe
 * layouts with weaker or stronger alignment constraints.
 *
 * <h2 id="layout-paths">Layout paths</h2>
 *
 * A <em>layout path</em> is used to unambiguously select a layout that is nested in some
 * other layout. Layout paths are typically expressed as a sequence of one or more
 * {@linkplain PathElement path elements}. (A more formal definition of layout paths is
 * provided <a href="#well-formedness">below</a>).
 * <p>
 * Layout paths can be used to:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>obtain {@linkplain MemoryLayout#byteOffset(PathElement...) offsets} of
 *     arbitrarily nested layouts;</li>
 *     <li>obtain a {@linkplain #varHandle(PathElement...) var handle} that can be used
 *     to access the value corresponding to the selected layout;</li>
 *     <li>{@linkplain #select(PathElement...) select} an arbitrarily nested layout.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For instance, given the {@code taggedValues} sequence layout constructed above, we can
 * obtain the offset, in bytes, of the member layout named <code>value</code> in the
 * <em>first</em> sequence element, as follows:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * long valueOffset = TAGGED_VALUES.byteOffset(PathElement.sequenceElement(0),
 *                                           PathElement.groupElement("value")); // yields 4
 * }
 *
 * Similarly, we can select the member layout named {@code value}, as follows:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemoryLayout value = TAGGED_VALUES.select(PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *                                          PathElement.groupElement("value"));
 * }
 *
 * <h3 id="open-path-elements">Open path elements</h3>
 *
 * Some layout path elements, said <em>open path elements</em>, can select multiple
 * layouts at once. For instance, the open path elements
 * {@link PathElement#sequenceElement()}, {@link PathElement#sequenceElement(long, long)}
 * select an unspecified element in a sequence layout. A var handle derived from a
 * layout path containing one or more open path element features additional coordinates
 * of type {@code long}, which can be used by clients to <em>bind</em> the open elements
 * in the path:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * VarHandle valueHandle = TAGGED_VALUES.varHandle(PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *                                                PathElement.groupElement("value"));
 * MemorySegment taggedValues = ...
 * // reads the "value" field of the third struct in the array (taggedValues[2].value)
 * int val = (int) valueHandle.get(taggedValues,
 *         0L,  // base offset
 *         2L); // sequence index
 * }
 *
 * <p>
 * Open path elements also affect the creation of
 * {@linkplain #byteOffsetHandle(PathElement...) offset-computing method handles}. Each
 * open path element becomes an additional {@code long} parameter in the obtained method
 * handle. This parameter can be used to specify the index of the sequence element whose
 * offset is to be computed:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MethodHandle offsetHandle = TAGGED_VALUES.byteOffsetHandle(PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *                                                           PathElement.groupElement("kind"));
 * long offset1 = (long) offsetHandle.invokeExact(0L, 1L); // 0 + (1 * 8) = 8
 * long offset2 = (long) offsetHandle.invokeExact(0L, 2L); // 0 + (2 * 8) = 16
 * }
 *
 * <h3 id="deref-path-elements">Dereference path elements</h3>
 *
 * A special kind of path element, called <em>dereference path element</em>, allows var
 * handles obtained from memory layouts to follow pointers. Consider the following layout:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * StructLayout RECTANGLE = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *         ValueLayout.ADDRESS.withTargetLayout(
 *                 MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(4,
 *                         MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *                                 ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("x"),
 *                                 ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("y")
 *                         ).withName("point")
*                  )
*          ).withName("points")
 * );
 * }
 *
 * This layout is a struct layout describing a rectangle. It contains a single field,
 * namely {@code points}, an address layout whose
 * {@linkplain AddressLayout#targetLayout() target layout} is a sequence layout of four
 * struct layouts. Each struct layout describes a two-dimensional point, and is defined
 * as a pair or {@link ValueLayout#JAVA_INT} coordinates, with names {@code x} and
 * {@code y}, respectively.
 * <p>
 * With dereference path elements, we can obtain a var handle that accesses the {@code y} coordinate of one of the
 * point in the rectangle, as follows:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * VarHandle rectPointYs = RECTANGLE.varHandle(
 *         PathElement.groupElement("points"),
 *         PathElement.dereferenceElement(),
 *         PathElement.sequenceElement(),
 *         PathElement.groupElement("y")
 * );
 *
 * MemorySegment rect = ...
 * // dereferences the third point struct in the "points" array, and reads its "y" coordinate (rect.points[2]->y)
 * int rect_y_2 = (int) rectPointYs.get(rect,
 *     0L,  // base offset
 *     2L); // sequence index
 * }
 *
 * <h3 id="well-formedness">Layout path well-formedness</h3>
 *
 * A layout path is applied to a layout {@code C_0}, also called the
 * <em>initial layout</em>. Each path element in a layout path can be thought of as a
 * function that updates the current layout {@code C_i-1} to some other layout
 * {@code C_i}. That is, for each path element {@code E1, E2, ... En}, in a layout path
 * {@code P}, we compute {@code C_i = f_i(C_i-1)}, where {@code f_i} is the selection
 * function associated with the path element under consideration, denoted as {@code E_i}.
 * The final layout {@code C_i} is also called the <em>selected layout</em>.
 * <p>
 * A layout path {@code P} is considered well-formed for an initial layout {@code C_0}
 * if all its path elements {@code E1, E2, ... En} are well-formed for their
 * corresponding input layouts {@code C_0, C_1, ... C_n-1}. A path element {@code E} is
 * considered well-formed for a layout {@code L} if any of the following is true:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code L} is a sequence layout and {@code E} is a sequence path element
 * (one of {@link PathElement#sequenceElement(long)}, {@link PathElement#sequenceElement(long, long)}
 * or {@link PathElement#sequenceElement()}). Moreover, if {@code E} contains one or
 * more sequence indices, such indices have to be compatible with the sequence layout's
 * element count;</li>
 * <li>{@code L} is a group layout and {@code E} is a group path element (one of
 * {@link PathElement#groupElement(String)} or {@link PathElement#groupElement(long)}).
 * Moreover, the group path element must refer to a valid member layout in
 * {@code L}, either by name, or index;</li>
 * <li>{@code L} is an address layout and {@code E} is a {@linkplain PathElement#dereferenceElement()
 * dereference path element}.
 * Moreover, {@code L} must define some {@linkplain AddressLayout#targetLayout() target layout}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Any attempt to provide a layout path {@code P} that is not well-formed for an initial
 * layout {@code C_0} will result in an {@link IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * <h2 id="access-mode-restrictions">Access mode restrictions</h2>
 *
 * A var handle returned by {@link #varHandle(PathElement...)} or
 * {@link ValueLayout#varHandle()} features certain access characteristics, which are
 * derived from the selected layout {@code L}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A carrier type {@code T}, derived from {@code L.carrier()}</li>
 * <li>An alignment constraint {@code A}, derived from {@code L.byteAlignment()}</li>
 * <li>An access size {@code S}, derived from {@code L.byteSize()}</li>
 * </ul>
 * Depending on the above characteristics, the returned var handle might feature certain
 * <i>access mode restrictions</i>. We say that a var handle is <em>aligned</em> if its
 * alignment constraint {@code A} is compatible with the access size {@code S}, that is
 * if {@code A >= S}. An aligned var handle is guaranteed to support the following
 * access modes:
 * <ul>
 * <li>read write access modes for all {@code T}. On 32-bit platforms, access modes
 *     {@code get} and {@code set} for {@code long}, {@code double} and {@code MemorySegment}
 *     are supported but might lead to word tearing, as described in Section {@jls 17.7}.
 *     of <cite>The Java Language Specification</cite>.
 * <li>atomic update access modes for {@code int}, {@code long},
 *     {@code float}, {@code double} and {@link MemorySegment}.
 *     (Future major platform releases of the JDK may support additional
 *     types for certain currently unsupported access modes.)
 * <li>numeric atomic update access modes for {@code int}, {@code long} and {@link MemorySegment}.
 *     (Future major platform releases of the JDK may support additional
 *     numeric types for certain currently unsupported access modes.)
 * <li>bitwise atomic update access modes for {@code int}, {@code long} and {@link MemorySegment}.
 *     (Future major platform releases of the JDK may support additional
 *     numeric types for certain currently unsupported access modes.)
 * </ul>
 * If {@code T} is {@code float}, {@code double} or {@link MemorySegment} then atomic
 * update access modes compare values using their bitwise representation
 * (see {@link Float#floatToRawIntBits}, {@link Double#doubleToRawLongBits}
 * and {@link MemorySegment#address()}, respectively).
 * <p>
 * Alternatively, a var handle is <em>unaligned</em> if its alignment constraint {@code A}
 * is incompatible with the access size {@code S}, that is, if {@code A < S}. An
 * unaligned var handle only supports the {@code get} and {@code set} access modes. All
 * other access modes will result in {@link UnsupportedOperationException} being thrown.
 * Moreover, while supported, access modes {@code get} and {@code set} might lead to
 * word tearing.
 *
 * <h2 id="variable-length">Working with variable-length arrays</h2>
 *
 * We have seen how sequence layouts are used to describe the contents of an array whose
 * size is known <em>statically</em>. There are cases, however, where the array size is
 * only known <em>dynamically</em>. We call such arrays <em>variable-length arrays</em>.
 * There are two common kinds of variable-length arrays:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a <em>toplevel</em> variable-length array whose size depends on the value of
 *     some unrelated variable, or parameter;</li>
 *     <li>an variable-length array <em>nested</em> in a struct, whose size depends on
 *     the value of some other field in the enclosing struct.</li>
 * </ul>
 * While variable-length arrays cannot be modeled directly using sequence layouts,
 * clients can still enjoy structured access to elements of variable-length arrays
 * using var handles as demonstrated in the following sections.
 *
 * <h3 id="variable-length-toplevel">Toplevel variable-length arrays</h3>
 *
 * Consider the following struct declaration in C:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=c :
 * typedef struct {
 *     int x;
 *     int y;
 * } Point;
 * }
 *
 * In the above code, a point is modeled as two coordinates ({@code x} and
 * {@code y} respectively). Now consider the following snippet of C code:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=c :
 * int size = ...
 * Point *points = (Point*)malloc(sizeof(Point) * size);
 * for (int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++) {
 *    ... points[i].x ...
 * }
 * }
 *
 * Here, we allocate an array of points ({@code points}). Crucially, the size of
 * the array is dynamically bound to the value of the {@code size} variable. Inside
 * the loop, the {@code x} coordinate of all the points in the array is accessed.
 * <p>
 * To model this code in Java, let's start by defining a layout for the {@code Point}
 * struct, as follows:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * StructLayout POINT = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *             ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("x"),
 *             ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("y")
 * );
 * }
 *
 * Since we know we need to create and access an array of points, it would be tempting to
 * create a sequence layout modelling the variable-length array, and then derive the
 * necessary access var handles from the sequence layout. But this approach is
 * problematic, as the size of the variable-length array is not known. Instead, a
 * var handle that provides structured access to the elements of a variable-length array
 * can be obtained directly from the layout describing the array elements
 * (e.g. the point layout), as demonstrated below:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * VarHandle POINT_ARR_X = POINT.arrayElementVarHandle(PathElement.groupElement("x"));
 *
 * int size = ...
 * MemorySegment points = ...
 * for (int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++) {
 *     ... POINT_ARR_X.get(segment, 0L, (long)i) ...
 * }
 * }
 *
 * Here, the coordinate {@code x} of subsequent point in the array is accessed using the
 * {@code POINT_ARR_X} var handle, which is obtained using the
 * {@link #arrayElementVarHandle(PathElement...)} method. This var handle features two
 * {@code long} coordinates: the first is a base offset (set to {@code 0L}), while the
 * second is a logical index that can be used to stride over all the elements of the
 * point array.
 * <p>
 * The base offset coordinate allows clients to express complex access operations, by
 * injecting additional offset computation into the var handle (we will see an example
 * of that below). In cases where the base offset is constant (as in the previous
 * example) clients can, if desired, drop the base offset parameter and make the access
 * expression simpler. This is achieved using the
 * {@link java.lang.invoke.MethodHandles#insertCoordinates(VarHandle, int, Object...)}
 * var handle adapter.
 *
 * <h3 id="variable-length-nested">Nested variable-length arrays</h3>
 *
 * Consider the following struct declaration in C:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=c :
 * typedef struct {
 *     int size;
 *     Point points[];
 * } Polygon;
 * }
 *
 * In the above code, a polygon is modeled as a size (the number of edges in the polygon)
 * and an array of points (one for each vertex in the polygon). The number of vertices
 * depends on the number of edges in the polygon. As such, the size of the {@code points}
 * array is left <em>unspecified</em> in the C declaration, using a
 * <em>Flexible Array Member</em> (a feature standardized in C99).
 * <p>
 * Again, clients can perform structured access to elements in the nested variable-length
 * array using the {@link #arrayElementVarHandle(PathElement...)} method, as demonstrated
 * below:
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * StructLayout POLYGON = MemoryLayout.structLayout(
 *             ValueLayout.JAVA_INT.withName("size"),
 *             MemoryLayout.sequenceLayout(0, POINT).withName("points")
 * );
 *
 * VarHandle POLYGON_SIZE = POLYGON.varHandle(0, PathElement.groupElement("size"));
 * long POINTS_OFFSET = POLYGON.byteOffset(PathElement.groupElement("points"));
 * }
 *
 * The {@code POLYGON} layout contains a sequence layout of size <em>zero</em>. The
 * element layout of the sequence layout is the {@code POINT} layout, shown previously.
 * The polygon layout is used to obtain a var handle that provides access to the polygon
 * size, as well as an offset ({@code POINTS_OFFSET}) to the start of the variable-length
 * {@code points} array.
 * <p>
 * The {@code x} coordinates of all the points in a polygon can then be accessed as
 * follows:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 * MemorySegment polygon = ...
 * int size = POLYGON_SIZE.get(polygon, 0L);
 * for (int i = 0 ; i < size ; i++) {
 *     ... POINT_ARR_X.get(polygon, POINTS_OFFSET, (long)i) ...
 * }
 *  }
 * Here, we first obtain the polygon size, using the {@code POLYGON_SIZE} var handle.
 * Then, in a loop, we read the {@code x} coordinates of all the points in the polygon.
 * This is done by providing a custom offset (namely, {@code POINTS_OFFSET}) to the
 * offset coordinate of the {@code POINT_ARR_X} var handle. As before, the loop
 * induction variable {@code i} is passed as the index of the {@code POINT_ARR_X}
 * var handle, to stride over all the elements of the variable-length array.
 *
