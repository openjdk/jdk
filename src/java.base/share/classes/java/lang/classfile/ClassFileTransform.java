/**
 * A transformation on streams of elements. Transforms are used during
 * transformation of classfile entities; a transform is provided to a method like
 * {@link ClassFile#transformClass(ClassModel, ClassTransform)}, and the elements of the class,
 * along with a builder, are presented to the transform.
 *
 * <p>The subtypes of {@linkplain
 * ClassFileTransform} (e.g., {@link ClassTransform}) are functional interfaces
 * that accept an element and a corresponding builder.  Since any element can be
 * reproduced on the builder via {@link ClassBuilder#with(ClassFileElement)}, a
 * transform can easily leave elements in place, remove them, replace them, or
 * augment them with other elements.  This enables localized transforms to be
 * represented concisely.
 *
 * <p>Transforms also have an {@link #atEnd(ClassFileBuilder)} method, for
 * which the default implementation does nothing, so that a transform can
 * perform additional building after the stream of elements is exhausted.
 *
 * <p>Transforms can be chained together via the {@link
 * #andThen(ClassFileTransform)} method, so that the output of one becomes the
 * input to another.  This allows smaller units of transformation to be captured
 * and reused.
 *
 * <p>Some transforms are stateful; for example, a transform that injects an
 * annotation on a class may watch for the {@link RuntimeVisibleAnnotationsAttribute}
 * element and transform it if found, but if it is not found, will generate a
 * {@linkplain RuntimeVisibleAnnotationsAttribute} element containing the
 * injected annotation from the {@linkplain #atEnd(ClassFileBuilder)} handler.
 * To do this, the transform must accumulate some state during the traversal so
 * that the end handler knows what to do.  If such a transform is to be reused,
 * its state must be reset for each traversal; this will happen automatically if
 * the transform is created with {@link ClassTransform#ofStateful(Supplier)} (or
 * corresponding methods for other classfile locations.)
 *
 * @param <C> the transform type
 * @param <E> the element type
 * @param <B> the builder type
