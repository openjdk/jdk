/**
 * A <i>thread</i> is a thread of execution in a program. The Java
 * virtual machine allows an application to have multiple threads of
 * execution running concurrently.
 *
 * <p> {@code Thread} defines constructors and a {@link Builder} to create threads.
 * {@linkplain #start() Starting} a thread schedules it to execute its {@link #run() run}
 * method. The newly started thread executes concurrently with the thread that caused
 * it to start.
 *
 * <p> A thread <i>terminates</i> if either its {@code run} method completes normally,
 * or if its {@code run} method completes abruptly and the appropriate {@linkplain
 * Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler uncaught exception handler} completes normally or
 * abruptly. With no code left to run, the thread has completed execution. The
 * {@link #join() join} method can be used to wait for a thread to terminate.
 *
 * <p> Threads have a unique {@linkplain #threadId() identifier} and a {@linkplain
 * #getName() name}. The identifier is generated when a {@code Thread} is created
 * and cannot be changed. The thread name can be specified when creating a thread
 * or can be {@linkplain #setName(String) changed} at a later time.
 *
 * <p> Threads support {@link ThreadLocal} variables. These are variables that are
 * local to a thread, meaning a thread can have a copy of a variable that is set to
 * a value that is independent of the value set by other threads. {@code Thread} also
 * supports {@link InheritableThreadLocal} variables that are thread local variables
 * that are inherited at thread creation time from the parent {@code Thread}.
 * {@code Thread} supports a special inheritable thread local for the thread
 * {@linkplain #getContextClassLoader() context-class-loader}.
 *
 * <h2><a id="platform-threads">Platform threads</a></h2>
 * <p> {@code Thread} supports the creation of <i>platform threads</i> that are
 * typically mapped 1:1 to kernel threads scheduled by the operating system.
 * Platform threads will usually have a large stack and other resources that are
 * maintained by the operating system. Platforms threads are suitable for executing
 * all types of tasks but may be a limited resource.
 *
 * <p> Platform threads get an automatically generated thread name by default.
 *
 * <p> Platform threads are designated <i>daemon</i> or <i>non-daemon</i> threads.
 * When the Java virtual machine starts up, there is usually one non-daemon
 * thread (the thread that typically calls the application's {@code main} method).
 * The <a href="Runtime.html#shutdown">shutdown sequence</a> begins when all started
 * non-daemon threads have terminated. Unstarted non-daemon threads do not prevent
 * the shutdown sequence from beginning.
 *
 * <p> In addition to the daemon status, platform threads have a {@linkplain
 * #getPriority() thread priority} and are members of a {@linkplain ThreadGroup
 * thread group}.
 *
 * <h2><a id="virtual-threads">Virtual threads</a></h2>
 * <p> {@code Thread} also supports the creation of <i>virtual threads</i>.
 * Virtual threads are typically <i>user-mode threads</i> scheduled by the Java
 * runtime rather than the operating system. Virtual threads will typically require
 * few resources and a single Java virtual machine may support millions of virtual
 * threads. Virtual threads are suitable for executing tasks that spend most of
 * the time blocked, often waiting for I/O operations to complete. Virtual threads
 * are not intended for long running CPU intensive operations.
 *
 * <p> Virtual threads typically employ a small set of platform threads used as
 * <em>carrier threads</em>. Locking and I/O operations are examples of operations
 * where a carrier thread may be re-scheduled from one virtual thread to another.
 * Code executing in a virtual thread is not aware of the underlying carrier thread.
 * The {@linkplain Thread#currentThread()} method, used to obtain a reference
 * to the <i>current thread</i>, will always return the {@code Thread} object
 * for the virtual thread.
 *
 * <p> Virtual threads do not have a thread name by default. The {@link #getName()
 * getName} method returns the empty string if a thread name is not set.
 *
 * <p> Virtual threads are daemon threads and so do not prevent the
 * <a href="Runtime.html#shutdown">shutdown sequence</a> from beginning.
 * Virtual threads have a fixed {@linkplain #getPriority() thread priority}
 * that cannot be changed.
 *
 * <h2>Creating and starting threads</h2>
 *
 * <p> {@code Thread} defines public constructors for creating platform threads and
 * the {@link #start() start} method to schedule threads to execute. {@code Thread}
 * may be extended for customization and other advanced reasons although most
 * applications should have little need to do this.
 *
 * <p> {@code Thread} defines a {@link Builder} API for creating and starting both
 * platform and virtual threads. The following are examples that use the builder:
 * {@snippet :
 *   Runnable runnable = ...
 *
 *   // Start a daemon thread to run a task
 *   Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().start(runnable);
 *
 *   // Create an unstarted thread with name "duke", its start() method
 *   // must be invoked to schedule it to execute.
 *   Thread thread = Thread.ofPlatform().name("duke").unstarted(runnable);
 *
 *   // A ThreadFactory that creates daemon threads named "worker-0", "worker-1", ...
 *   ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofPlatform().daemon().name("worker-", 0).factory();
 *
 *   // Start a virtual thread to run a task
 *   Thread thread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(runnable);
 *
 *   // A ThreadFactory that creates virtual threads
 *   ThreadFactory factory = Thread.ofVirtual().factory();
 * }
 *
 * <h2><a id="inheritance">Inheritance when creating threads</a></h2>
 * A {@code Thread} inherits its initial values of {@linkplain InheritableThreadLocal
 * inheritable-thread-local} variables (including the context class loader) from
 * the parent thread values at the time that the child {@code Thread} is created.
 * The 5-param {@linkplain Thread#Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String, long, boolean)
 * constructor} can be used to create a thread that does not inherit its initial
 * values from the constructing thread. When using a {@code Thread.Builder}, the
 * {@link Builder#inheritInheritableThreadLocals(boolean) inheritInheritableThreadLocals}
 * method can be used to select if the initial values are inherited.
 *
 * <p> Platform threads inherit the daemon status, thread priority, and when not
 * provided (or not selected by a security manager), the thread group.
 *
 * <p> Creating a platform thread {@linkplain AccessController#getContext() captures} the
 * {@linkplain AccessControlContext caller context} to limit the {@linkplain Permission
 * permissions} of the new thread when it executes code that performs a {@linkplain
 * AccessController#doPrivileged(PrivilegedAction) privileged action}. The captured
 * caller context is the new thread's "Inherited {@link AccessControlContext}". Creating
 * a virtual thread does not capture the caller context; virtual threads have no
 * permissions when executing code that performs a privileged action.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * @implNote
 * In the JDK Reference Implementation, the virtual thread scheduler may be configured
 * with the following system properties:
 * <table class="striped">
 * <caption style="display:none">System properties</caption>
 *   <thead>
 *   <tr>
 *     <th scope="col">System property</th>
 *     <th scope="col">Description</th>

     * platform-specific minimum value; if the specified value is unreasonably
     * high, the virtual machine may instead use some platform-specific
     * maximum.  Likewise, the virtual machine is free to round the specified
     * value up or down as it sees fit (or to ignore it completely).
     *
     * <p>Specifying a value of zero for the {@code stackSize} parameter will
     * cause this constructor to behave exactly like the
     * {@code Thread(ThreadGroup, Runnable, String)} constructor.
     *
     * <p><i>Due to the platform-dependent nature of the behavior of this
     * constructor, extreme care should be exercised in its use.
     * The thread stack size necessary to perform a given computation will
     * likely vary from one JRE implementation to another.  In light of this

     * @deprecated This method was originally specified to "stop" a victim
     *       thread by causing the victim thread to throw a {@link ThreadDeath}.
     *       It was inherently unsafe. Stopping a thread caused it to unlock
     *       all of the monitors that it had locked (as a natural consequence
     *       of the {@code ThreadDeath} exception propagating up the stack). If
     *       any of the objects previously protected by these monitors were in
     *       an inconsistent state, the damaged objects became visible to
     *       other threads, potentially resulting in arbitrary behavior.
     *       Usages of {@code stop} should be replaced by code that simply
     *       modifies some variable to indicate that the target thread should
     *       stop running.  The target thread should check this variable
     *       regularly, and return from its run method in an orderly fashion
     *       if the variable indicates that it is to stop running.  If the
     *       target thread waits for long periods (on a condition variable,
     *       for example), the {@code interrupt} method should be used to
     *       interrupt the wait.
     *       For more information, see
     *       <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/lang/doc-files/threadPrimitiveDeprecation.html">Why
