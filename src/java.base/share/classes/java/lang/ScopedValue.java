/**
 * A value that may be safely and efficiently shared to methods without using method
 * parameters.
 *
 * <p> In the Java programming language, data is usually passed to a method by means of a
 * method parameter. The data may need to be passed through a sequence of many methods to
 * get to the method that makes use of the data. Every method in the sequence of calls
 * needs to declare the parameter and every method has access to the data.
 * {@code ScopedValue} provides a means to pass data to a faraway method (typically a
 * <em>callback</em>) without using method parameters. In effect, a {@code ScopedValue}
 * is an <em>implicit method parameter</em>. It is "as if" every method in a sequence of
 * calls has an additional parameter. None of the methods declare the parameter and only
 * the methods that have access to the {@code ScopedValue} object can access its value
 * (the data). {@code ScopedValue} makes it possible to securely pass data from a
 * <em>caller</em> to a faraway <em>callee</em> through a sequence of intermediate methods
 * that do not declare a parameter for the data and have no access to the data.
 *
 * <p> The {@code ScopedValue} API works by executing a method with a {@code ScopedValue}
 * object <em>bound</em> to some value for the bounded period of execution of a method.
 * The method may invoke another method, which in turn may invoke another. The unfolding
 * execution of the methods define a <em>dynamic scope</em>. Code in these methods with
 * access to the {@code ScopedValue} object may read its value. The {@code ScopedValue}
 * object reverts to being <em>unbound</em> when the original method completes normally or
 * with an exception. The {@code ScopedValue} API supports executing a {@link Runnable},
 * or {@link CallableOp} with a {@code ScopedValue} bound to a value.
 *
 * <p> Consider the following example with a scoped value "{@code NAME}" bound to the value
 * "{@code duke}" for the execution of a {@code Runnable}'s {@code run} method.
 * The {@code run} method, in turn, invokes a method {@code doSomething}.
 *
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     // @link substring="newInstance" target="#newInstance" :
 *     private static final ScopedValue<String> NAME = ScopedValue.newInstance();
 *
 *     // @link substring="run" target="Carrier#run(Runnable)" :
 *     ScopedValue.where(NAME, "duke").run(() -> doSomething());
 * }
 * Code executed directly or indirectly by {@code doSomething}, with access to the field
 * {@code NAME}, can invoke {@code NAME.get()} to read the value "{@code duke}". {@code
 * NAME} is bound while executing the {@code run} method. It reverts to being unbound when
 * the {@code run} method completes.
 *
 * <p> The example using {@code run} invokes a method that does not return a result.
 * The {@link Carrier#call(CallableOp) call} method can be used
 * to invoke a method that returns a result.
 * {@code ScopedValue} defines the {@link #where(ScopedValue, Object)} method
 * for cases where multiple mappings (of {@code ScopedValue} to value) are accumulated
 * in advance of calling a method with all {@code ScopedValue}s bound to their value.
 *
 * <h2>Bindings are per-thread</h2>
 *
 * A {@code ScopedValue} binding to a value is per-thread. Invoking {@code run}
 * executes a method with a {@code ScopedValue} bound to a value for the current thread.
 * The {@link #get() get} method returns the value bound for the current thread.
 *
 * <p> In the example, if code executed by one thread invokes this:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     ScopedValue.where(NAME, "duke1").run(() -> doSomething());
 * }
 * and code executed by another thread invokes:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     ScopedValue.where(NAME, "duke2").run(() -> doSomething());
 * }
 * then code in {@code doSomething} (or any method that it calls) invoking {@code NAME.get()}
 * will read the value "{@code duke1}" or "{@code duke2}", depending on which thread is
 * executing.
 *
 * <h2>Scoped values as capabilities</h2>
 *
 * A {@code ScopedValue} object should be treated as a <em>capability</em> or a key to
 * access its value when the {@code ScopedValue} is bound. Secure usage depends on access
 * control (see <cite>The Java Virtual Machine Specification</cite>, Section {@jvms 5.4.4})
 * and taking care to not share the {@code ScopedValue} object. In many cases, a {@code
 * ScopedValue} will be declared in a {@code final} and {@code static} field so that it
 * is only accessible to code in a single class (or nest).
 *
 * <h2><a id="rebind">Rebinding</a></h2>
 *
 * The {@code ScopedValue} API allows a new binding to be established for <em>nested
 * dynamic scopes</em>. This is known as <em>rebinding</em>. A {@code ScopedValue} that
 * is bound to a value may be bound to a new value for the bounded execution of a new
 * method. The unfolding execution of code executed by that method defines the nested
 * dynamic scope. When the method completes, the value of the {@code ScopedValue} reverts
 * to its previous value.
 *
 * <p> In the above example, suppose that code executed by {@code doSomething} binds
 * {@code NAME} to a new value with:
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     ScopedValue.where(NAME, "duchess").run(() -> doMore());
 * }
 * Code executed directly or indirectly by {@code doMore()} that invokes {@code
 * NAME.get()} will read the value "{@code duchess}". When {@code doMore()} completes
 * then the value of {@code NAME} reverts to "{@code duke}".
 *
 * <h2><a id="inheritance">Inheritance</a></h2>
 *
 * {@code ScopedValue} supports sharing across threads. This sharing is limited to
 * structured cases where child threads are started and terminate within the bounded
 * period of execution by a parent thread. When using a {@link StructuredTaskScope},
 * scoped value bindings are <em>captured</em> when creating a {@code StructuredTaskScope}
 * and inherited by all threads started in that task scope with the
 * {@link StructuredTaskScope#fork(java.util.concurrent.Callable) fork} method.
 *
 * <p> A {@code ScopedValue} that is shared across threads requires that the value be an
 * immutable object or for all access to the value to be appropriately synchronized.
 *
 * <p> In the following example, the {@code ScopedValue} {@code NAME} is bound to the
 * value "{@code duke}" for the execution of a runnable operation. The code in the {@code
 * run} method creates a {@code StructuredTaskScope} that forks three tasks. Code executed
 * directly or indirectly by these threads running {@code childTask1()}, {@code childTask2()},
 * and {@code childTask3()} that invokes {@code NAME.get()} will read the value
 * "{@code duke}".
 *
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     private static final ScopedValue<String> NAME = ScopedValue.newInstance();

 *     ScopedValue.where(NAME, "duke").run(() -> {
 *         try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope<String>()) {
 *
 *              // @link substring="fork" target="StructuredTaskScope#fork(java.util.concurrent.Callable)" :
 *              scope.fork(() -> childTask1());
 *              scope.fork(() -> childTask2());
 *              scope.fork(() -> childTask3());
 *
 *              // @link substring="join" target="StructuredTaskScope#join()" :
 *              scope.join();
 *
 *              ..
 *          }
 *     });
 * }
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a method in this
 * class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * A {@code ScopedValue} should be preferred over a {@link ThreadLocal} for cases where
 * the goal is "one-way transmission" of data without using method parameters.  While a
 * {@code ThreadLocal} can be used to pass data to a method without using method parameters,
 * it does suffer from a number of issues:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> {@code ThreadLocal} does not prevent code in a faraway callee from {@linkplain
 *   ThreadLocal#set(Object) setting} a new value.
 *   <li> A {@code ThreadLocal} has an unbounded lifetime and thus continues to have a value
 *   after a method completes, unless explicitly {@linkplain ThreadLocal#remove() removed}.
 *   <li> {@linkplain InheritableThreadLocal Inheritance} is expensive - the map of
 *   thread-locals to values must be copied when creating each child thread.
 * </ol>
 *
 * @implNote
 * Scoped values are designed to be used in fairly small
 * numbers. {@link #get} initially performs a search through enclosing
 * scopes to find a scoped value's innermost binding. It
 * then caches the result of the search in a small thread-local
 * cache. Subsequent invocations of {@link #get} for that scoped value
 * will almost always be very fast. However, if a program has many
 * scoped values that it uses cyclically, the cache hit rate
 * will be low and performance will be poor. This design allows
 * scoped-value inheritance by {@link StructuredTaskScope} threads to
 * be very fast: in essence, no more than copying a pointer, and
 * leaving a scoped-value binding also requires little more than
 * updating a pointer.
 *
 * <p>Because the scoped-value per-thread cache is small, clients
 * should minimize the number of bound scoped values in use. For
 * example, if it is necessary to pass a number of values in this way,
 * it makes sense to create a record class to hold those values, and
 * then bind a single {@code ScopedValue} to an instance of that record.
 *
 * <p>For this release, the reference implementation
 * provides some system properties to tune the performance of scoped
 * values.
 *
 * <p>The system property {@code java.lang.ScopedValue.cacheSize}
 * controls the size of the (per-thread) scoped-value cache. This cache is crucial
 * for the performance of scoped values. If it is too small,
 * the runtime library will repeatedly need to scan for each
 * {@link #get}. If it is too large, memory will be unnecessarily
 * consumed. The default scoped-value cache size is 16 entries. It may
 * be varied from 2 to 16 entries in size. {@code ScopedValue.cacheSize}
 * must be an integer power of 2.
 *
 * <p>For example, you could use {@code -Djava.lang.ScopedValue.cacheSize=8}.
 *
 * <p>The other system property is {@code jdk.preserveScopedValueCache}.
 * This property determines whether the per-thread scoped-value
 * cache is preserved when a virtual thread is blocked. By default
 * this property is set to {@code true}, meaning that every virtual
 * thread preserves its scoped-value cache when blocked. Like {@code
 * ScopedValue.cacheSize}, this is a space versus speed trade-off: in
 * situations where many virtual threads are blocked most of the time,
 * setting this property to {@code false} might result in a useful
 * memory saving, but each virtual thread's scoped-value cache would
 * have to be regenerated after a blocking operation.
