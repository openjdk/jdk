    /* The state of a Reference object is characterized by two attributes.  It
     * may be either "active", "pending", or "inactive".  It may also be
     * either "registered", "enqueued", "dequeued", or "unregistered".
     *
     *   Active: Subject to special treatment by the garbage collector.  Some
     *   time after the collector detects that the reachability of the
     *   referent has changed to the appropriate state, the collector
     *   "notifies" the reference, changing the state to either "pending" or
     *   "inactive".
     *   referent != null; discovered = null, or in GC discovered list.
     *
     *   Pending: An element of the pending-Reference list, waiting to be
     *   processed by the ReferenceHandler thread.  The pending-Reference
     *   list is linked through the discovered fields of references in the
     *   list.
     *   referent = null; discovered = next element in pending-Reference list.
     *
     *   Inactive: Neither Active nor Pending.
     *   referent = null.
     *
     *   Registered: Associated with a queue when created, and not yet added
     *   to the queue.
     *   queue = the associated queue.
     *
     *   Enqueued: Added to the associated queue, and not yet removed.
     *   queue = ReferenceQueue.ENQUEUE; next = next entry in list, or this to
     *   indicate end of list.
     *
     *   Dequeued: Added to the associated queue and then removed.
     *   queue = ReferenceQueue.NULL; next = this.
     *
     *   Unregistered: Not associated with a queue when created.
     *   queue = ReferenceQueue.NULL.
     *
     * The collector only needs to examine the referent field and the
     * discovered field to determine whether a (non-FinalReference) Reference
     * object needs special treatment.  If the referent is non-null and not
     * known to be live, then it may need to be discovered for possible later
     * notification.  But if the discovered field is non-null, then it has
     * already been discovered.
     *
     * FinalReference (which exists to support finalization) differs from
     * other references, because a FinalReference is not cleared when
     * notified.  The referent being null or not cannot be used to distinguish
     * between the active state and pending or inactive states.  However,
     * FinalReferences do not support enqueue().  Instead, the next field of a
     * FinalReference object is set to "this" when it is added to the
     * pending-Reference list.  The use of "this" as the value of next in the
     * enqueued and dequeued states maintains the non-active state.  An
     * additional check that the next field is null is required to determine
     * that a FinalReference object is active.

     *   [active/registered]
     *   [active/unregistered] [1]

     * Ensures that the given object remains
     * <a href="package-summary.html#reachability"><em>strongly reachable</em></a>.
     * This reachability is assured regardless of any optimizing transformations
     * the virtual machine may perform that might otherwise allow the object to
     * become unreachable (see JLS {@jls 12.6.1}). Thus, the given object is not
     * reclaimable by garbage collection at least until after the invocation of
     * this method. References to the given object will not be cleared (or
     * enqueued, if applicable) by the garbage collector until after invocation
     * of this method.
     * Invocation of this method does not itself initiate reference processing,
     * garbage collection, or finalization.
     *
     * <p> This method establishes an ordering for <em>strong reachability</em>
     * with respect to garbage collection.  It controls relations that are
     * otherwise only implicit in a program -- the reachability conditions
     * triggering garbage collection.  This method is applicable only
     * when reclamation may have visible effects,
     * such as for objects that use finalizers or {@link Cleaner}, or code that
     * performs {@linkplain java.lang.ref reference processing}.
     *
     * <p>{@linkplain java.lang.ref##MemoryConsistency Memory consistency effects}:
     * Actions in a thread prior to calling {@code reachabilityFence(x)}
     * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
     * the garbage collector clears any reference to {@code x}.
     *
     * @apiNote
     * Reference processing or finalization can occur after an object becomes
     * unreachable. An object can become unreachable when the virtual machine
     * detects that there is no further need for the object (other than for
     * running a finalizer). In the course of optimization, the virtual machine
     * can reorder operations of an object's methods such that the object
     * becomes unneeded earlier than might naively be expected &mdash;
     * including while a method of the object is still running. For instance,
     * the VM can move the loading of <em>values</em> from the object's fields
     * to occur earlier. The object itself is then no longer needed and becomes
     * unreachable, and the method can continue running using the obtained values.
     * This may have surprising and undesirable effects when using a Cleaner or
     * finalizer for cleanup: there is a race between the
     * program thread running the method, and the cleanup thread running the
     * Cleaner or finalizer. The cleanup thread could free a
     * resource, followed by the program thread (still running the method)
     * attempting to access the now-already-freed resource.
     * Use of {@code reachabilityFence} can prevent this race by ensuring that the
     * object remains strongly reachable.
     * <p>
     * The following is an example in which the bookkeeping associated with a class is
     * managed through array indices.  Here, method {@code action} uses a
     * {@code reachabilityFence} to ensure that the {@code Resource} object is
     * not reclaimed before bookkeeping on an associated
     * {@code ExternalResource} has been performed; specifically, to
     * ensure that the array slot holding the {@code ExternalResource} is not
     * nulled out in method {@link Object#finalize}, which may otherwise run
     * concurrently.
     *
     * {@snippet :
     * class Resource {
     *   private static ExternalResource[] externalResourceArray = ...
     *
     *   int myIndex;
     *   Resource(...) {
     *     this.myIndex = ...
     *     externalResourceArray[myIndex] = ...;
     *     ...
     *   }
     *   protected void finalize() {
     *     externalResourceArray[this.myIndex] = null;
     *     ...
     *   }
     *   public void action() {
     *     try {
     *       // ...
     *       int i = this.myIndex; // last use of 'this' Resource in action()
     *       Resource.update(externalResourceArray[i]);
     *     } finally {
     *       Reference.reachabilityFence(this);
     *     }
     *   }
     *   private static void update(ExternalResource ext) {
     *     ext.status = ...;
     *   }
     * }
     * }
     *
     * The invocation of {@code reachabilityFence} is
     * placed <em>after</em> the call to {@code update}, to ensure that the
     * array slot is not nulled out by {@link Object#finalize} before the
     * update, even if the call to {@code action} was the last use of this
     * object.  This might be the case if, for example, a usage in a user program
     * had the form {@code new Resource().action();} which retains no other
     * reference to this {@code Resource}.
     * The {@code reachabilityFence} call is placed in a {@code finally} block to
     * ensure that it is invoked across all paths in the method. A more complex
     * method might need further precautions to ensure that
     * {@code reachabilityFence} is encountered along all code paths.
     *
     * <p> Method {@code reachabilityFence} is not required in constructions
     * that themselves ensure reachability.  For example, because objects that
     * are locked cannot, in general, be reclaimed, it would suffice if all
     * accesses of the object, in all methods of class {@code Resource}
     * (including {@code finalize}) were enclosed in {@code synchronized (this)}
     * blocks.  (Further, such blocks must not include infinite loops, or
     * themselves be unreachable, which fall into the corner case exceptions to
     * the "in general" disclaimer.)  However, method {@code reachabilityFence}
     * remains a better option in cases where synchronization is not as efficient,
     * desirable, or possible; for example because it would encounter deadlock.
     *
     * @param ref the reference to the object to keep strongly reachable. If
     * {@code null}, this method has no effect.
