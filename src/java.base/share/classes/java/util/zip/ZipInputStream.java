/**
 * An input stream for reading compressed and uncompressed
 * {@linkplain ZipEntry ZIP file entries} from a stream of bytes in the ZIP file
 * format.
 * <p> Unless otherwise noted, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be
 * thrown.
 * <H2>Reading Zip File Entries</H2>
 *
 * The {@link #getNextEntry()} method is used to read the next ZIP file entry
 * (Local file (LOC) header record in the ZIP format) and position the stream at
 * the entry's file data. The file data may read using one of the
 * {@code ZipInputStream} read methods such
 * as {@link #read(byte[], int, int) read} or {@link #readAllBytes() readAllBytes()}.
 * For example:
 *    {@snippet lang="java" :
 *      Path jar = Path.of("foo.jar");
 *      try (InputStream is = Files.newInputStream(jar);
 *           ZipInputStream zis = new ZipInputStream(is)) {
 *          ZipEntry ze;
 *          while ((ze = zis.getNextEntry()) != null) {
 *             var bytes = zis.readAllBytes();
 *             System.out.printf("Entry: %s, bytes read: %s%n", ze.getName(),
 *                     bytes.length);
 *          }
 *      }
 *    }
 * @apiNote
 * The LOC header contains metadata about the ZIP file entry. {@code ZipInputStream}
 * does not read the Central directory (CEN) header for the entry and therefore
 * will not have access to its metadata such as the external file attributes.
 * {@linkplain ZipFile} may be used when the information stored within
 * the CEN header is required.
