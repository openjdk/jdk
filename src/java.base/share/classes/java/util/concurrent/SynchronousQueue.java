/**
 * A {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} in which each insert
 * operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another
 * thread, and vice versa.  A synchronous queue does not have any
 * internal capacity, not even a capacity of one.  You cannot
 * {@code peek} at a synchronous queue because an element is only
 * present when you try to remove it; you cannot insert an element
 * (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it;
 * you cannot iterate as there is nothing to iterate.  The
 * <em>head</em> of the queue is the element that the first queued
 * inserting thread is trying to add to the queue; if there is no such
 * queued thread then no element is available for removal and
 * {@code poll()} will return {@code null}.  For purposes of other
 * {@code Collection} methods (for example {@code contains}), a
 * {@code SynchronousQueue} acts as an empty collection.  This queue
 * does not permit {@code null} elements.
 *
 * <p>Synchronous queues are similar to rendezvous channels used in
 * CSP and Ada. They are well suited for handoff designs, in which an
 * object running in one thread must sync up with an object running
 * in another thread in order to hand it some information, event, or
 * task.
 *
 * <p>This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
 * waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
 * is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
 * to {@code true} grants threads access in FIFO order.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the <em>optional</em>
 * methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/java.base/java/util/package-summary.html#CollectionsFramework">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

     * This class implements extensions of the dual stack and dual
     * queue algorithms described in "Nonblocking Concurrent Objects
     * with Condition Synchronization", by W. N. Scherer III and
     * M. L. Scott.  18th Annual Conf. on Distributed Computing,
     * Oct. 2004 (see also
     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/pseudocode/duals.html).
     * The queue is treated as a Lifo stack in non-fair mode, and a
     * Fifo queue in fair mode. In most contexts, transfer performance
     * is roughly comparable across them. Lifo is usually faster under
     * low contention, but slower under high contention.  Performance
     * of applications using them also varies. Lifo is generally
     * preferable in resource management settings (for example cached
     * thread pools) because of better temporal locality, but
     * inappropriate for message-passing applications.
     *
     * A dual queue is one that at any given time either holds "data"
     * -- items provided by put operations, or "requests" -- slots
     * representing take operations, or is empty. A fulfilling
     * operation (i.e., a call requesting an item from a queue holding
     * data or vice versa) "matches" the item of and then dequeues a
     * complementary node.  Any operation can figure out which mode
     * the queue is in, and act accordingly without needing locks.  So
     * put and take operations are symmetrical, and all transfer
     * methods invoke a single "xfer" method that does a put or a take
     * in either fifo or lifo mode.
     *
     * The algorithms here differ from the versions in the above paper
     * in ways including:
     *
     *  * The original algorithms used bit-marked pointers, but the
     *     ones here use a bit (isData) in nodes, and usually avoid
     *     creating nodes when fulfilling. They also use the
     *     compareAndExchange form of CAS for pointer updates to
     *     reduce memory traffic.
     *  * Fifo mode is based on LinkedTransferQueue operations, but
     *     Lifo mode support is added in subclass Transferer.
     *  * The Fifo version accommodates lazy updates and slack as
     *     described in LinkedTransferQueue internal documentation.
     *  * Threads may block when waiting to become fulfilled,
     *     sometimes preceded by brief spins.
     *  * Support for cancellation via timeout and interrupts,
     *     including cleaning out cancelled nodes/threads from lists
     *     to avoid garbage retention and memory depletion.
