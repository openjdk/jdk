/**
 * A basic API for <em>structured concurrency</em>. {@code StructuredTaskScope} supports
 * cases where a task splits into several concurrent subtasks, and where the subtasks must
 * complete before the main task continues. A {@code StructuredTaskScope} can be used to
 * ensure that the lifetime of a concurrent operation is confined by a <em>syntax block</em>,
 * just like that of a sequential operation in structured programming.
 *
 * <h2>Basic operation</h2>
 *
 * A {@code StructuredTaskScope} is created with one of its public constructors. It defines
 * the {@link #fork(Callable) fork} method to start a thread to execute a subtask, the {@link
 * #join() join} method to wait for all subtasks to finish, and the {@link #close() close}
 * method to close the task scope. The API is intended to be used with the {@code
 * try-with-resources} statement. The intention is that code in the try <em>block</em>
 * uses the {@code fork} method to fork threads to execute the subtasks, wait for the
 * subtasks to finish with the {@code join} method, and then <em>process the results</em>.
 * A call to the {@code fork} method returns a {@link Subtask Subtask} to representing
 * the <em>forked subtask</em>. Once {@code join} is called, the {@code Subtask} can be
 * used to get the result completed successfully, or the exception if the subtask failed.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     Callable<String> task1 = ...
 *     Callable<Integer> task2 = ...
 *
 *     try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope<Object>()) {
 *
 *         Subtask<String> subtask1 = scope.fork(task1);   // @highlight substring="fork"
 *         Subtask<Integer> subtask2 = scope.fork(task2);  // @highlight substring="fork"
 *
 *         scope.join();                                   // @highlight substring="join"
 *
 *         ... process results/exceptions ...
 *
 *     } // close                                          // @highlight substring="close"
 * }
 * <p> The following example forks a collection of homogeneous subtasks, waits for all of
 * them to complete with the {@code join} method, and uses the {@link Subtask.State
 * Subtask.State} to partition the subtasks into a set of the subtasks that completed
 * successfully and another for the subtasks that failed.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     List<Callable<String>> callables = ...
 *
 *     try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope<String>()) {
 *
 *         List<Subtask<String>> subtasks = callables.stream().map(scope::fork).toList();
 *
 *         scope.join();
 *
 *         Map<Boolean, Set<Subtask<String>>> map = subtasks.stream()
 *                 .collect(Collectors.partitioningBy(h -> h.state() == Subtask.State.SUCCESS,
 *                                                    Collectors.toSet()));
 *
 *     } // close
 * }
 *
 * <p> To ensure correct usage, the {@code join} and {@code close} methods may only be
 * invoked by the <em>owner</em> (the thread that opened/created the task scope), and the
 * {@code close} method throws an exception after closing if the owner did not invoke the
 * {@code join} method after forking.
 *
 * <p> {@code StructuredTaskScope} defines the {@link #shutdown() shutdown} method to shut
 * down a task scope without closing it. The {@code shutdown()} method <em>cancels</em> all
 * unfinished subtasks by {@linkplain Thread#interrupt() interrupting} the threads. It
 * prevents new threads from starting in the task scope. If the owner is waiting in the
 * {@code join} method then it will wakeup.
 *
 * <p> Shutdown is used for <em>short-circuiting</em> and allow subclasses to implement
 * <em>policy</em> that does not require all subtasks to finish.
 *
 * <h2>Subclasses with policies for common cases</h2>
 *
 * Two subclasses of {@code StructuredTaskScope} are defined to implement policy for
 * common cases:
 * <ol>
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnSuccess ShutdownOnSuccess} captures the result of the first
 *   subtask to complete successfully. Once captured, it shuts down the task scope to
 *   interrupt unfinished threads and wakeup the owner. This class is intended for cases
 *   where the result of any subtask will do ("invoke any") and where there is no need to
 *   wait for results of other unfinished subtasks. It defines methods to get the first
 *   result or throw an exception if all subtasks fail.
 *   <li> {@link ShutdownOnFailure ShutdownOnFailure} captures the exception of the first
 *   subtask to fail. Once captured, it shuts down the task scope to interrupt unfinished
 *   threads and wakeup the owner. This class is intended for cases where the results of all
 *   subtasks are required ("invoke all"); if any subtask fails then the results of other
 *   unfinished subtasks are no longer needed. If defines methods to throw an exception if
 *   any of the subtasks fail.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p> The following are two examples that use the two classes. In both cases, a pair of
 * subtasks are forked to fetch resources from two URL locations "left" and "right". The
 * first example creates a ShutdownOnSuccess object to capture the result of the first
 * subtask to complete successfully, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the task
 * scope. The main task waits in {@code join} until either subtask completes with a result
 * or both subtasks fail. It invokes {@link ShutdownOnSuccess#result(Function)
 * result(Function)} method to get the captured result. If both subtasks fail then this
 * method throws a {@code WebApplicationException} with the exception from one of the
 * subtasks as the cause.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess<String>()) {
 *
 *         scope.fork(() -> fetch(left));
 *         scope.fork(() -> fetch(right));
 *
 *         scope.join();
 *
 *         // @link regex="result(?=\()" target="ShutdownOnSuccess#result" :
 *         String result = scope.result(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 * The second example creates a ShutdownOnFailure object to capture the exception of the
 * first subtask to fail, cancelling the other by way of shutting down the task scope. The
 * main task waits in {@link #joinUntil(Instant)} until both subtasks complete with a
 * result, either fails, or a deadline is reached. It invokes {@link
 * ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed(Function) throwIfFailed(Function)} to throw an exception
 * if either subtask fails. This method is a no-op if both subtasks complete successfully.
 * The example uses {@link Supplier#get()} to get the result of each subtask. Using
 * {@code Supplier} instead of {@code Subtask} is preferred for common cases where the
 * object returned by fork is only used to get the result of a subtask that completed
 * successfully.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *    Instant deadline = ...
 *
 *    try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
 *
 *         Supplier<String> supplier1 = scope.fork(() -> query(left));
 *         Supplier<String> supplier2 = scope.fork(() -> query(right));
 *
 *         scope.joinUntil(deadline);
 *
 *         // @link substring="throwIfFailed" target="ShutdownOnFailure#throwIfFailed" :
 *         scope.throwIfFailed(e -> new WebApplicationException(e));
 *
 *         // both subtasks completed successfully
 *         String result = Stream.of(supplier1, supplier2)
 *                 .map(Supplier::get)
 *                 .collect(Collectors.joining(", ", "{ ", " }"));
 *
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <h2>Extending StructuredTaskScope</h2>
 *
 * {@code StructuredTaskScope} can be extended, and the {@link #handleComplete(Subtask)
 * handleComplete} method overridden, to implement policies other than those implemented
 * by {@code ShutdownOnSuccess} and {@code ShutdownOnFailure}. A subclass may, for example,
 * collect the results of subtasks that complete successfully and ignore subtasks that
 * fail. It may collect exceptions when subtasks fail. It may invoke the {@link #shutdown()
 * shutdown} method to shut down and cause {@link #join() join} to wakeup when some
 * condition arises.
 *
 * <p> A subclass will typically define methods to make available results, state, or other
 * outcome to code that executes after the {@code join} method. A subclass that collects
 * results and ignores subtasks that fail may define a method that returns the results.
 * A subclass that implements a policy to shut down when a subtask fails may define a
 * method to get the exception of the first subtask to fail.
 *
 * <p> The following is an example of a simple {@code StructuredTaskScope} implementation
 * that collects homogenous subtasks that complete successfully. It defines the method
 * "{@code completedSuccessfully()}" that the main task can invoke after it joins.
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     class CollectingScope<T> extends StructuredTaskScope<T> {
 *         private final Queue<Subtask<? extends T>> subtasks = new LinkedTransferQueue<>();
 *
 *         @Override
 *         protected void handleComplete(Subtask<? extends T> subtask) {
 *             if (subtask.state() == Subtask.State.SUCCESS) {
 *                 subtasks.add(subtask);
 *             }
 *         }
 *
 *         @Override
 *         public CollectingScope<T> join() throws InterruptedException {
 *             super.join();
 *             return this;
 *         }
 *
 *         public Stream<Subtask<? extends T>> completedSuccessfully() {
 *             // @link substring="ensureOwnerAndJoined" target="ensureOwnerAndJoined" :
 *             super.ensureOwnerAndJoined();
 *             return subtasks.stream();
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * <p> The implementations of the {@code completedSuccessfully()} method in the example
 * invokes {@link #ensureOwnerAndJoined()} to ensure that the method can only be invoked
 * by the owner thread and only after it has joined.
 *
 * <h2><a id="TreeStructure">Tree structure</a></h2>
 *
 * Task scopes form a tree where parent-child relations are established implicitly when
 * opening a new task scope:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> A parent-child relation is established when a thread started in a task scope
 *   opens its own task scope. A thread started in task scope "A" that opens task scope
 *   "B" establishes a parent-child relation where task scope "A" is the parent of task
 *   scope "B".
 *   <li> A parent-child relation is established with nesting. If a thread opens task
 *   scope "B", then opens task scope "C" (before it closes "B"), then the enclosing task
 *   scope "B" is the parent of the nested task scope "C".
 * </ul>
 *
 * The <i>descendants</i> of a task scope are the child task scopes that it is a parent
 * of, plus the descendants of the child task scopes, recursively.
 *
 * <p> The tree structure supports:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Inheritance of {@linkplain ScopedValue scoped values} across threads.
 *   <li> Confinement checks. The phrase "threads contained in the task scope" in method
 *   descriptions means threads started in the task scope or descendant scopes.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p> The following example demonstrates the inheritance of a scoped value. A scoped
 * value {@code USERNAME} is bound to the value "{@code duke}". A {@code StructuredTaskScope}
 * is created and its {@code fork} method invoked to start a thread to execute {@code
 * childTask}. The thread inherits the scoped value <em>bindings</em> captured when
 * creating the task scope. The code in {@code childTask} uses the value of the scoped
 * value and so reads the value "{@code duke}".
 * {@snippet lang=java :
 *     private static final ScopedValue<String> USERNAME = ScopedValue.newInstance();
 *
 *     // @link substring="runWhere" target="ScopedValue#runWhere(ScopedValue, Object, Runnable)" :
 *     ScopedValue.runWhere(USERNAME, "duke", () -> {
 *         try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope<String>()) {
 *
 *             scope.fork(() -> childTask());           // @highlight substring="fork"
 *             ...
 *          }
 *     });
 *
 *     ...
 *
 *     String childTask() {
 *         // @link substring="get" target="ScopedValue#get()" :
 *         String name = USERNAME.get();   // "duke"
 *         ...
 *     }
 * }
 *
 * <p> {@code StructuredTaskScope} does not define APIs that exposes the tree structure
 * at this time.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a constructor
 * or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
 *
 * <h2>Memory consistency effects</h2>
