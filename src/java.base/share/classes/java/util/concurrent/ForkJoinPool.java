/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active
 * tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
 * enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks
 * (as do most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small
 * tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients.  Especially
 * when setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in constructors, {@code
 * ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style
 * tasks that are never joined. All worker threads are initialized
 * with {@link Thread#isDaemon} set {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>A static {@link #commonPool()} is available and appropriate for
 * most applications. The common pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that
 * is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the common
 * pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly
 * reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent
 * use).
 *
 * <p>For applications that require separate or custom pools, a {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} may be constructed with a given target parallelism
 * level; by default, equal to the number of available processors.
 * The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads
 * by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker
 * threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join others.
 * However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked
 * I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested {@link
 * ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 * synchronization accommodated. The default policies may be
 * overridden using a constructor with parameters corresponding to
 * those documented in class {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p>As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 * main task execution methods summarized in the following table.
 * These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
 * engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main
 * forms of these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask},
 * but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead
 * use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using
 * async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case
 * there is little difference among choice of methods.
 *
 * <table class="plain">
 * <caption>Summary of task execution methods</caption>

 *
 * <p>The parameters used to construct the common pool may be controlled by
 * setting the following {@linkplain System#getProperty system properties}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@systemProperty java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism}
 * - the parallelism level, a non-negative integer
 * <li>{@systemProperty java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.threadFactory}
 * - the class name of a {@link ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory}.
 * The {@linkplain ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader}
 * is used to load this class.
 * <li>{@systemProperty java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.exceptionHandler}
 * - the class name of a {@link UncaughtExceptionHandler}.
 * The {@linkplain ClassLoader#getSystemClassLoader() system class loader}
 * is used to load this class.
 * <li>{@systemProperty java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.maximumSpares}
 * - the maximum number of allowed extra threads to maintain target
 * parallelism (default 256).
 * </ul>
 * If no thread factory is supplied via a system property, then the
 * common pool uses a factory that uses the system class loader as the
 * {@linkplain Thread#getContextClassLoader() thread context class loader}.
 * In addition, if a {@link SecurityManager} is present, then
 * the common pool uses a factory supplying threads that have no
 * {@link Permissions} enabled, and are not guaranteed to preserve
 * the values of {@link java.lang.ThreadLocal} variables across tasks.
 *
 * Upon any error in establishing these settings, default parameters
 * are used. It is possible to disable or limit the use of threads in
 * the common pool by setting the parallelism property to zero, and/or
 * using a factory that may return {@code null}. However doing so may
 * cause unjoined tasks to never be executed.
 *
 * @implNote This implementation restricts the maximum number of
 * running threads to 32767. Attempts to create pools with greater
 * than the maximum number result in {@code
 * IllegalArgumentException}. Also, this implementation rejects
 * submitted tasks (that is, by throwing {@link
 * RejectedExecutionException}) only when the pool is shut down or
 * internal resources have been exhausted.

     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class and its nested classes provide the main
     * functionality and control for a set of worker threads.  Because
     * most internal methods and nested classes are interrelated,
     * their main rationale and descriptions are presented here;
     * individual methods and nested classes contain only brief
     * comments about details. Broadly: submissions from non-FJ
     * threads enter into submission queues.  Workers take these tasks
     * and typically split them into subtasks that may be stolen by
     * other workers. Work-stealing based on randomized scans
     * generally leads to better throughput than "work dealing" in
     * which producers assign tasks to idle threads, in part because
     * threads that have finished other tasks before the signalled
     * thread wakes up (which can be a long time) can take the task
     * instead.  Preference rules give first priority to processing
     * tasks from their own queues (LIFO or FIFO, depending on mode),
     * then to randomized FIFO steals of tasks in other queues.  This
     * framework began as vehicle for supporting tree-structured
     * parallelism using work-stealing.  Over time, its scalability
     * advantages led to extensions and changes to better support more
     * diverse usage contexts.  Here's a brief history of major
     * revisions, each also with other minor features and changes.
     *
     * 1. Only handle recursively structured computational tasks
     * 2. Async (FIFO) mode and striped submission queues
     * 3. Completion-based tasks (mainly CountedCompleters)
     * 4. CommonPool and parallelStream support
     * 5. InterruptibleTasks for externally submitted tasks
     *
     * Most changes involve adaptions of base algorithms using
     * combinations of static and dynamic bitwise mode settings (both
     * here and in ForkJoinTask), and subclassing of ForkJoinTask.
     * There are a fair number of odd code constructions and design
     * decisions for components that reside at the edge of Java vs JVM
     * functionality.
     *
     * WorkQueues
     * ==========
     *
     * Most operations occur within work-stealing queues (in nested
     * class WorkQueue).  These are special forms of Deques that
     * support only three of the four possible end-operations -- push,
     * pop, and poll (aka steal), under the further constraints that
     * push and pop are called only from the owning thread (or, as
     * extended here, under a lock), while poll may be called from
     * other threads.  (If you are unfamiliar with them, you probably
     * want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book "The Art of
     * Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these in
     * more detail before proceeding.)  The main work-stealing queue
     * design is roughly similar to those in the papers "Dynamic
     * Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005
     * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and
     * "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev,
     * PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186).
     * The main differences ultimately stem from GC requirements that
     * we null out taken slots as soon as we can, to maintain as small
     * a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge
     * numbers of tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS
     * arbitrating pop vs poll (steal) from being on the indices
     * ("base" and "top") to the slots themselves. These provide the
     * primary required memory ordering -- see "Correct and Efficient
     * Work-Stealing for Weak Memory Models" by Le, Pop, Cohen, and
     * Nardelli, PPoPP 2013
     * (http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/readings/ppopp13.pdf) for an
     * analysis of memory ordering requirements in work-stealing
     * algorithms similar to the one used here.  We use per-operation
     * ordered writes of various kinds for updates, but usually use
     * explicit load fences for reads, to cover access of several
     * fields of possibly several objects without further constraining
     * read-by-read ordering.
     *
     * We also support a user mode in which local task processing is
     * in FIFO, not LIFO order, simply by using a local version of
     * poll rather than pop.  This can be useful in message-passing
     * frameworks in which tasks are never joined, although with
     * increased contention among task producers and consumers. Also,
     * the same data structure (and class) is used for "submission
     * queues" (described below) holding externally submitted tasks,
     * that differ only in that a lock (using field "phase"; see below) is
     * required by external callers to push and pop tasks.
     *
     * Adding tasks then takes the form of a classic array push(task)
     * in a circular buffer:
     *    q.array[q.top++ % length] = task;
     *
     * The actual code needs to null-check and size-check the array,
     * uses masking, not mod, for indexing a power-of-two-sized array,
     * enforces memory ordering, supports resizing, and possibly
     * signals waiting workers to start scanning (described below),
     * which requires stronger forms of order accesses.
     *
     * The pop operation (always performed by owner) is of the form:
     *   if ((task = getAndSet(q.array, (q.top-1) % length, null)) != null)
     *        decrement top and return task;
     * If this fails, the queue is empty. This operation is one part
     * of the nextLocalTask method, that instead does a local-poll
     * in FIFO mode.
     *
     * The poll operation is, basically:
     *   if (CAS nonnull task t = q.array[k = q.base % length] to null)
     *       increment base and return task;
     *
     * However, there are several more cases that must be dealt with.
     * Some of them are just due to asynchrony; others reflect
     * contention and stealing policies. Stepping through them
     * illustrates some of the implementation decisions in this class.
     *
     *  * Slot k must be read with an acquiring read, which it must
     *    anyway to dereference and run the task if the (acquiring)
     *    CAS succeeds, but uses an explicit acquire fence to support
     *    the following rechecks even if the CAS is not attempted.  To
     *    more easily distinguish among kinds of CAS failures, we use
     *    the compareAndExchange version, and usually handle null
     *    returns (indicating contention) separately from others.
     *
     *  * q.base may change between reading and using its value to
     *    index the slot. To avoid trying to use the wrong t, the
     *    index and slot must be reread (not necessarily immediately)
     *    until consistent, unless this is a local poll by owner, in
     *    which case this form of inconsistency can only appear as t
     *    being null, below.
     *
     *  * Similarly, q.array may change (due to a resize), unless this
     *    is a local poll by owner. Otherwise, when t is present, this
     *    only needs consideration on CAS failure (since a CAS
     *    confirms the non-resized case.)
     *
     *  * t may appear null because a previous poll operation has not
     *    yet incremented q.base, so the read is from an already-taken
     *    index. This form of stall reflects the non-lock-freedom of
     *    the poll operation. Stalls can be detected by observing that
     *    q.base doesn't change on repeated reads of null t and when
     *    no other alternatives apply, spin-wait for it to settle.  To
     *    reduce producing these kinds of stalls by other stealers, we
     *    encourage timely writes to indices using otherwise
     *    unnecessarily strong writes.
     *
     *  * The CAS may fail, in which case we may want to retry unless
     *    there is too much contention. One goal is to balance and
     *    spread out the many forms of contention that may be
     *    encountered across polling and other operations to avoid
     *    sustained performance degradations. Across all cases where
     *    alternatives exist, a bounded number of CAS misses or stalls
     *    are tolerated (for slots, ctl, and elsewhere described
     *    below) before taking alternative action. These may move
     *    contention or retries elsewhere, which is still preferable
     *    to single-point bottlenecks.
     *
     *  * Even though the check "top == base" is quiescently accurate
     *    to determine whether a queue is empty, it is not of much use
     *    when deciding whether to try to poll or repoll after a
     *    failure.  Both top and base may move independently, and both
     *    lag updates to the underlying array. To reduce memory
     *    contention, non-owners avoid reading the "top" when
     *    possible, by using one-ahead reads to check whether to
     *    repoll, relying on the fact that a non-empty queue does not
     *    have two null slots in a row, except in cases (resizes and
     *    shifts) that can be detected with a secondary recheck that
     *    is less likely to conflict with owner writes.
     *
     * The poll operations in q.poll(), scan(), helpJoin(), and
     * elsewhere differ with respect to whether other queues are
     * available to try, and the presence or nature of screening steps
     * when only some kinds of tasks can be taken. When alternatives
     * (or failing) is an option, they uniformly give up after
     * bounded numbers of stalls and/or CAS failures, which reduces
     * contention when too many workers are polling too few tasks.
     * Overall, in the aggregate, we ensure probabilistic
     * non-blockingness of work-stealing at least until checking
     * quiescence (which is intrinsically blocking): If an attempted
     * steal fails in these ways, a scanning thief chooses a different
     * target to try next. In contexts where alternatives aren't
     * available, and when progress conditions can be isolated to
     * values of a single variable, simple spinloops (using
     * Thread.onSpinWait) are used to reduce memory traffic.
     *
     * WorkQueues are also used in a similar way for tasks submitted
     * to the pool. We cannot mix these tasks in the same queues used
     * by workers. Instead, we randomly associate submission queues
     * with submitting threads, using a form of hashing.  The
     * ThreadLocalRandom probe value serves as a hash code for
     * choosing existing queues, and may be randomly repositioned upon
     * contention with other submitters.  In essence, submitters act
     * like workers except that they are restricted to executing local
     * tasks that they submitted (or when known, subtasks thereof).
     * Insertion of tasks in shared mode requires a lock. We use only
     * a simple spinlock (as one role of field "phase") because
     * submitters encountering a busy queue move to a different
     * position to use or create other queues.  They (spin) block when
     * registering new queues, or indirectly elsewhere, by revisiting
     * later.
     *
     * Management
     * ==========
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly take tasks from
     * themselves or each other, at rates that can exceed a billion
     * per second.  Most non-atomic control is performed by some form
     * of scanning across or within queues.  The pool itself creates,
     * activates (enables scanning for and running tasks),
     * deactivates, blocks, and terminates threads, all with minimal
     * central information.  There are only a few properties that we
     * can globally track or maintain, so we pack them into a small
     * number of variables, often maintaining atomicity without
     * blocking or locking.  Nearly all essentially atomic control
     * state is held in a few variables that are by far most often
     * read (not written) as status and consistency checks. We pack as
     * much information into them as we can.
     *
     * Field "ctl" contains 64 bits holding information needed to
     * atomically decide to add, enqueue (on an event queue), and
     * dequeue and release workers.  To enable this packing, we
     * restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (which is far in
     * excess of normal operating range) to allow ids, counts, and
     * their negations (used for thresholding) to fit into 16bit
     * subfields.
     *
     * Field "runState" and per-WorkQueue field "phase" play similar
     * roles, as lockable, versioned counters. Field runState also
     * includes monotonic event bits (SHUTDOWN, STOP, and TERMINATED).
     * The version tags enable detection of state changes (by
     * comparing two reads) modulo bit wraparound. The bit range in
     * each case suffices for purposes of determining quiescence,
     * termination, avoiding ABA-like errors, and signal control, most
     * of which are ultimately based on at most 15bit ranges (due to
     * 32767 max total workers). RunState updates do not need to be
     * atomic with respect to ctl updates, but because they are not,
     * some care is required to avoid stalls. The seqLock properties
     * detect changes and conditionally upgrade to coordinate with
     * updates. It is typically held for less than a dozen
     * instructions unless the queue array is being resized, during
     * which contention is rare. To be conservative, lockRunState is
     * implemented as a spin/sleep loop. Here and elsewhere spin
     * constants are short enough to apply even on systems with few
     * available processors.  In addition to checking pool status,
     * reads of runState sometimes serve as acquire fences before
     * reading other fields.
     *
     * Field "parallelism" holds the target parallelism (normally
     * corresponding to pool size). Users can dynamically reset target
     * parallelism, but is only accessed when signalling or awaiting
     * work, so only slowly has an effect in creating threads or
     * letting them time out and terminate when idle.
     *
     * Array "queues" holds references to WorkQueues.  It is updated
     * (only during worker creation and termination) under the
     * runState lock. It is otherwise concurrently readable but reads
     * for use in scans (see below) are always prefaced by a volatile
     * read of runState (or equivalent constructions), ensuring that
     * its state is current at the point it is used (which is all we
     * require). To simplify index-based operations, the array size is
     * always a power of two, and all readers must tolerate null
     * slots.  Worker queues are at odd indices. Worker phase ids
     * masked with SMASK match their index. Shared (submission) queues
     * are at even indices. Grouping them together in this way aids in
     * task scanning: At top-level, both kinds of queues should be
     * sampled with approximately the same probability, which is
     * simpler if they are all in the same array. But we also need to
     * identify what kind they are without looking at them, leading to
     * this odd/even scheme. One disadvantage is that there are
     * usually many fewer submission queues, so there can be many
     * wasted probes (null slots). But this is still cheaper than
     * alternatives. Other loops over the queues array vary in origin
     * and stride depending on whether they cover only submission
     * (even) or worker (odd) queues or both, and whether they require
     * randomness (in which case cyclically exhaustive strides may be
     * used).
     *
     * All worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task
     * submissions, replacement of terminated workers, and/or
     * compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support
     * code is set up to work with other policies.  To ensure that we
     * do not hold on to worker or task references that would prevent
     * GC, all accesses to workQueues in waiting, signalling, and
     * control methods are via indices into the queues array (which is
     * one source of some of the messy code constructions here). In
     * essence, the queues array serves as a weak reference
     * mechanism. In particular, the stack top subfield of ctl stores
     * indices, not references. Operations on queues obtained from
     * these indices remain valid (with at most some unnecessary extra
     * work) even if an underlying worker failed and was replaced by
     * another at the same index. During termination, worker queue
     * array updates are disabled.
     *
     * Queuing Idle Workers. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we
     * cannot let workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when
     * none can be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume
     * workers unless there appear to be tasks available.  On the
     * other hand, we must quickly prod them into action when new
     * tasks are submitted or generated. These latencies are mainly a
     * function of JVM park/unpark (and underlying OS) performance,
     * which can be slow and variable (even though usages are
     * streamlined as much as possible).  In many usages, ramp-up time
     * is the main limiting factor in overall performance, which is
     * compounded at program start-up by JIT compilation and
     * allocation. On the other hand, throughput degrades when too
     * many threads poll for too few tasks. (See below.)
     *
     * The "ctl" field atomically maintains total and "released"
     * worker counts, plus the head of the available worker queue
     * (actually stack, represented by the lower 32bit subfield of
     * ctl).  Released workers are those known to be scanning for
     * and/or running tasks (we cannot accurately determine
     * which). Unreleased ("available") workers are recorded in the
     * ctl stack. These workers are made eligible for signalling by
     * enqueuing in ctl (see method runWorker).  This "queue" is a
     * form of Treiber stack. This is ideal for activating threads in
     * most-recently used order, and improves performance and
     * locality, outweighing the disadvantages of being prone to
     * contention and inability to release a worker unless it is
     * topmost on stack. The top stack state holds the value of the
     * "phase" field of the worker: its index and status, plus a
     * version counter that, in addition to the count subfields (also
     * serving as version stamps) provide protection against Treiber
     * stack ABA effects.
     *
     * Creating workers. To create a worker, we pre-increment counts
     * (serving as a reservation), and attempt to construct a
     * ForkJoinWorkerThread via its factory. On starting, the new
     * thread first invokes registerWorker, where it constructs a
     * WorkQueue and is assigned an index in the queues array
     * (expanding the array if necessary).  Upon any exception across
     * these steps, or null return from factory, deregisterWorker
     * adjusts counts and records accordingly.  If a null return, the
     * pool continues running with fewer than the target number
     * workers. If exceptional, the exception is propagated, generally
     * to some external caller.
     *
     * WorkQueue field "phase" encodes the queue array id in lower
     * bits, and otherwise acts similarly to the pool runState field:
     * The "IDLE" bit is clear while active (either a released worker
     * or a locked external queue), with other bits serving as a
     * version counter to distinguish changes across multiple reads.
     * Note that phase field updates lag queue CAS releases; seeing a
     * non-idle phase does not guarantee that the worker is available
     * (and so is never checked in this way).
     *
     * The ctl field also serves as the basis for memory
     * synchronization surrounding activation. This uses a more
     * efficient version of a Dekker-like rule that task producers and
     * consumers sync with each other by both writing/CASing ctl (even
     * if to its current value).  However, rather than CASing ctl to
     * its current value in the common case where no action is
     * required, we reduce write contention by ensuring that
     * signalWork invocations are prefaced with a fully fenced memory
     * access (which is usually needed anyway).
     *
     * Signalling. Signals (in signalWork) cause new or reactivated
     * workers to scan for tasks.  Method signalWork and its callers
     * try to approximate the unattainable goal of having the right
     * number of workers activated for the tasks at hand, but must err
     * on the side of too many workers vs too few to avoid stalls:
     *
     *  * If computations are purely tree structured, it suffices for
     *    every worker to activate another when it pushes a task into
     *    an empty queue, resulting in O(log(#threads)) steps to full
     *    activation. Emptiness must be conservatively approximated,
     *    sometimes resulting in unnecessary signals.  Also, to reduce
     *    resource usages in some cases, at the expense of slower
     *    startup in others, activation of an idle thread is preferred
     *    over creating a new one, here and elsewhere.
     *
     *  * If instead, tasks come in serially from only a single
     *    producer, each worker taking its first (since the last
     *    activation) task from a queue should propagate a signal if
     *    there are more tasks in that queue. This is equivalent to,
     *    but generally faster than, arranging the stealer take
     *    multiple tasks, re-pushing one or more on its own queue, and
     *    signalling (because its queue is empty), also resulting in
     *    logarithmic full activation time
     *
     * * Because we don't know about usage patterns (or most commonly,
     *    mixtures), we use both approaches, which present even more
     *    opportunities to over-signal.  Note that in either of these
     *    contexts, signals may be (and often are) unnecessary because
     *    active workers continue scanning after running tasks without
     *    the need to be signalled (which is one reason work stealing
     *    is often faster than alternatives), so additional workers
     *    aren't needed. We filter out some of these cases by exiting
     *    retry loops in signalWork if the task responsible for the
     *    signal has already been taken.
     *
     * * For rapidly branching tasks that require full pool resources,
     *   oversignalling is OK, because signalWork will soon have no
     *   more workers to create or reactivate. But for others (mainly
     *   externally submitted tasks), overprovisioning may cause very
     *   noticeable slowdowns due to contention and resource
     *   wastage. All remedies are intrinsically heuristic. We use a
     *   strategy that works well in most cases: We track "sources"
     *   (queue ids) of non-empty (usually polled) queues while
     *   scanning. These are maintained in the "source" field of
     *   WorkQueues for use in method helpJoin and elsewhere (see
     *   below). We also maintain them as arguments/results of
     *   top-level polls (argument "window" in method scan, with setup
     *   in method runWorker) as an encoded sliding window of current
     *   and previous two sources (or INVALID_ID if none), and stop
     *   signalling when all were from the same source. These
     *   mechanisms may result in transiently too few workers, but
     *   once workers poll from a new source, they rapidly reactivate
     *   others.
     *
     * * Despite these, signal contention and overhead effects still
     *   occur during ramp-up and ramp-down of small computations.
     *
     * Scanning. Method scan performs top-level scanning for (and
     * execution of) tasks by polling a pseudo-random permutation of
     * the array (by starting at a given index, and using a constant
     * cyclically exhaustive stride.)  It uses the same basic polling
     * method as WorkQueue.poll(), but restarts with a different
     * permutation on each invocation.  The pseudorandom generator
     * need not have high-quality statistical properties in the long
     * term. We use Marsaglia XorShifts, seeded with the Weyl sequence
     * from ThreadLocalRandom probes, which are cheap and
     * suffice. Scans do not otherwise explicitly take into account
     * core affinities, loads, cache localities, etc, However, they do
     * exploit temporal locality (which usually approximates these) by
     * preferring to re-poll from the same queue (either in method
     * tryPoll() or scan) after a successful poll before trying others
     * (see method topLevelExec), which also reduces bookkeeping,
     * cache traffic, and scanning overhead. But it also reduces
     * fairness, which is partially counteracted by giving up on
     * contention.
     *
     * Deactivation. When method scan indicates that no tasks are
     * found by a worker, it tries to deactivate (in awaitWork),
     * giving up (and rescanning) on ctl contention. To avoid missed
     * signals during deactivation, the method rescans and reactivates
     * if there may have been a missed signal during deactivation,
     * filtering out most cases in which this is unnecessary. Because
     * idle workers are often not yet blocked (parked), we use the
     * WorkQueue parking field to advertise that a waiter actually
     * needs unparking upon signal.
     *
     * Quiescence. Workers scan looking for work, giving up when they
     * don't find any, without being sure that none are available.
     * However, some required functionality relies on consensus about
     * quiescence (also termination, discussed below). The count
     * fields in ctl allow accurate discovery of states in which all
     * workers are idle.  However, because external (asynchronous)
     * submitters are not part of this vote, these mechanisms
     * themselves do not guarantee that the pool is in a quiescent
     * state with respect to methods isQuiescent, shutdown (which
     * begins termination when quiescent), helpQuiesce, and indirectly
     * others including tryCompensate. Method quiescent() is
     * used in all of these contexts. It provides checks that all
     * workers are idle and there are no submissions that they could
     * poll if they were not idle, retrying on inconsistent reads of
     * queues and using the runState seqLock to retry on queue array
     * updates.  (It also reports quiescence if the pool is
     * terminating.) A true report means only that there was a moment
     * at which quiescence held.  False negatives are inevitable (for
     * example when queues indices lag updates, as described above),
     * which is accommodated when (tentatively) idle by scanning for
     * work etc, and then re-invoking. This includes cases in which
     * the final unparked thread (in awaitWork) uses quiescent()
     * to check for tasks that could have been added during a race
     * window that would not be accompanied by a signal, in which case
     * re-activating itself (or any other worker) to rescan. Method
     * helpQuiesce acts similarly but cannot rely on ctl counts to
     * determine that all workers are inactive because the caller and
     * any others executing helpQuiesce are not included in counts.
     *
     * Termination. A call to shutdownNow invokes tryTerminate to
     * atomically set a runState mode bit.  However, the process of
     * termination is intrinsically non-atomic. The calling thread, as
     * well as other workers thereafter terminating help cancel queued
     * tasks and interrupt other workers. These actions race with
     * unterminated workers.  By default, workers check for
     * termination only when accessing pool state.  This may take a
     * while but suffices for structured computational tasks.  But not
     * necessarily for others. Class InterruptibleTask (see below)
     * further arranges runState checks before executing task bodies,
     * and ensures interrupts while terminating. Even so, there are no
     * guarantees after an abrupt shutdown that remaining tasks
     * complete normally or exceptionally or are cancelled.
     * Termination may fail to complete if running tasks ignore both
     * task status and interrupts and/or produce more tasks after
     * others that could cancel them have exited.
     *
     * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of
     * use, a worker starting to wait when the pool is quiescent will
     * time out and terminate if the pool has remained quiescent for
     * period given by field keepAlive (default 60sec), which applies
     * to the first timeout of a fully populated pool. Subsequent (or
     * other) cases use delays such that, if still quiescent, all will
     * be released before one additional keepAlive unit elapses.
     *
     * Joining Tasks
     * =============
     *
     * The "Join" part of ForkJoinPools consists of a set of
     * mechanisms that sometimes or always (depending on the kind of
     * task) avoid context switching or adding worker threads when one
     * task would otherwise be blocked waiting for completion of
     * another, basically, just by running that task or one of its
     * subtasks if not already taken. These mechanics are disabled for
     * InterruptibleTasks, that guarantee that callers do not execute
     * submitted tasks.
     *
     * The basic structure of joining is an extended spin/block scheme
     * in which workers check for task completions status between
     * steps to find other work, until relevant pool state stabilizes
     * enough to believe that no such tasks are available, at which
     * point blocking. This is usually a good choice of when to block
     * that would otherwise be harder to approximate.
     *
     * These forms of helping may increase stack space usage, but that
     * space is bounded in tree/dag structured procedurally parallel
     * designs to be no more than that if a task were executed only by
     * the joining thread. This is arranged by associated task
     * subclasses that also help detect and control the ways in which
     * this may occur.
     *
     * Normally, the first option when joining a task that is not done
     * is to try to take it from the local queue and run it. Method
     * tryRemoveAndExec tries to do so.  For tasks with any form of
     * subtasks that must be completed first, we try to locate these
     * subtasks and run them as well. This is easy when local, but
     * when stolen, steal-backs are restricted to the same rules as
     * stealing (polling), which requires additional bookkeeping and
     * scanning. This cost is still very much worthwhile because of
     * its impact on task scheduling and resource control.
     *
     * The two methods for finding and executing subtasks vary in
     * details.  The algorithm in helpJoin entails a form of "linear
     * helping".  Each worker records (in field "source") the index of
     * the internal queue from which it last stole a task. (Note:
     * because chains cannot include even-numbered external queues,
     * they are ignored, and 0 is an OK default.) The scan in method
     * helpJoin uses these markers to try to find a worker to help
     * (i.e., steal back a task from and execute it) that could make
     * progress toward completion of the actively joined task.  Thus,
     * the joiner executes a task that would be on its own local deque
     * if the to-be-joined task had not been stolen. This is a
     * conservative variant of the approach described in Wagner &
     * Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable technique for implementing
     * efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices, 1993
     * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs
     * mainly in that we only record queues, not full dependency
     * links.  This requires a linear scan of the queues to locate
     * stealers, but isolates cost to when it is needed, rather than
     * adding to per-task overhead.  For CountedCompleters, the
     * analogous method helpComplete doesn't need stealer-tracking,
     * but requires a similar (but simpler) check of completion
     * chains.
     *
     * In either case, searches can fail to locate stealers when
     * stalls delay recording sources or issuing subtasks. We avoid
     * some of these cases by using snapshotted values of ctl as a
     * check that the numbers of workers are not changing, along with
     * rescans to deal with contention and stalls.  But even when
     * accurately identified, stealers might not ever produce a task
     * that the joiner can in turn help with.
     *
     * Related method helpAsyncBlocker does not directly rely on
     * subtask structure, but instead avoids or postpones blocking of
     * tagged tasks (CompletableFuture.AsynchronousCompletionTask) by
     * executing other asyncs that can be processed in any order.
     * This is currently invoked only in non-join-based blocking
     * contexts from classes CompletableFuture and
     * SubmissionPublisher, that could be further generalized.
     *
     * When any of the above fail to avoid blocking, we rely on
     * "compensation" -- an indirect form of context switching that
     * either activates an existing worker to take the place of the
     * blocked one, or expands the number of workers.
     *
     * Compensation does not by default aim to keep exactly the target
     * parallelism number of unblocked threads running at any given
     * time. Some previous versions of this class employed immediate
     * compensations for any blocked join. However, in practice, the
     * vast majority of blockages are transient byproducts of GC and
     * other JVM or OS activities that are made worse by replacement
     * by causing longer-term oversubscription. These are inevitable
     * without (unobtainably) perfect information about whether worker
     * creation is actually necessary.  False alarms are common enough
     * to negatively impact performance, so compensation is by default
     * attempted only when it appears possible that the pool could
     * stall due to lack of any unblocked workers.  However, we allow
     * users to override defaults using the long form of the
     * ForkJoinPool constructor. The compensation mechanism may also
     * be bounded.  Bounds for the commonPool better enable JVMs to
     * cope with programming errors and abuse before running out of
     * resources to do so.
     *
     * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies
     * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker. This API was
     * designed to highlight the uncertainty of compensation decisions
     * by requiring implementation of method isReleasable to abort
     * compensation during attempts to obtain a stable snapshot. But
     * users now rely upon the fact that if isReleasable always
     * returns false, the API can be used to obtain precautionary
     * compensation, which is sometimes the only reasonable option
     * when running unknown code in tasks; which is now supported more
     * simply (see method beginCompensatedBlock).
     *
     * Common Pool
     * ===========
     *
     * The static common pool always exists after static
     * initialization.  Since it (or any other created pool) need
     * never be used, we minimize initial construction overhead and
     * footprint to the setup of about a dozen fields, although with
     * some System property parsing and security processing that takes
     * far longer than the actual construction when SecurityManagers
     * are used or properties are set. The common pool is
     * distinguished by having a null workerNamePrefix (which is an
     * odd convention, but avoids the need to decode status in factory
     * classes).  It also has PRESET_SIZE config set if parallelism
     * was configured by system property.
     *
     * When external threads use the common pool, they can perform
     * subtask processing (see helpComplete and related methods) upon
     * joins, unless they are submitted using ExecutorService
     * submission methods, which implicitly disallow this.  This
     * caller-helps policy makes it sensible to set common pool
     * parallelism level to one (or more) less than the total number
     * of available cores, or even zero for pure caller-runs. External
     * threads waiting for joins first check the common pool for their
     * task, which fails quickly if the caller did not fork to common
     * pool.
     *
     * Guarantees for common pool parallelism zero are limited to
     * tasks that are joined by their callers in a tree-structured
     * fashion or use CountedCompleters (as is true for jdk
     * parallelStreams). Support infiltrates several methods,
     * including those that retry helping steps until we are sure that
     * none apply if there are no workers.
     *
     * As a more appropriate default in managed environments, unless
     * overridden by system properties, we use workers of subclass
     * InnocuousForkJoinWorkerThread when there is a SecurityManager
     * present. These workers have no permissions set, do not belong
     * to any user-defined ThreadGroup, and clear all ThreadLocals
     * after executing any top-level task.  The associated mechanics
     * may be JVM-dependent and must access particular Thread class
     * fields to achieve this effect.
     *
     * InterruptibleTasks
     * ====================
     *
     * Regular ForkJoinTasks manage task cancellation (method cancel)
     * independently from the interrupt status of threads running
     * tasks.  Interrupts are issued internally only while
     * terminating, to wake up workers and cancel queued tasks.  By
     * default, interrupts are cleared only when necessary to ensure
     * that calls to LockSupport.park do not loop indefinitely (park
     * returns immediately if the current thread is interrupted).
     *
     * To comply with ExecutorService specs, we use subclasses of
     * abstract class InterruptibleTask for tasks that require
     * stronger interruption and cancellation guarantees.  External
     * submitters never run these tasks, even if in the common pool.
     * InterruptibleTasks include a "runner" field (implemented
     * similarly to FutureTask) to support cancel(true).  Upon pool
     * shutdown, runners are interrupted so they can cancel. Since
     * external joining callers never run these tasks, they must await
     * cancellation by others, which can occur along several different
     * paths.
     *
     * Across these APIs, rules for reporting exceptions for tasks
     * with results accessed via join() differ from those via get(),
     * which differ from those invoked using pool submit methods by
     * non-workers (which comply with Future.get() specs). Internal
     * usages of ForkJoinTasks ignore interrupt status when executing
     * or awaiting completion.  Otherwise, reporting task results or
     * exceptions is preferred to throwing InterruptedExecptions,
     * which are in turn preferred to timeouts. Similarly, completion
     * status is preferred to reporting cancellation.  Cancellation is
     * reported as an unchecked exception by join(), and by worker
     * calls to get(), but is otherwise wrapped in a (checked)
     * ExecutionException.
     *
     * Worker Threads cannot be VirtualThreads, as enforced by
     * requiring ForkJoinWorkerThreads in factories.  There are
     * several constructions relying on this.  However as of this
     * writing, virtual thread bodies are by default run as some form
     * of InterruptibleTask.
     *
     * Memory placement
     * ================
     *
     * Performance is very sensitive to placement of instances of
     * ForkJoinPool and WorkQueues and their queue arrays, as well as
     * the placement of their fields. Caches misses and contention due
     * to false-sharing have been observed to slow down some programs
     * by more than a factor of four. Effects may vary across initial
     * memory configuarations, applications, and different garbage
     * collectors and GC settings, so there is no perfect solution.
     * Too much isolation may generate more cache misses in common
     * cases (because some fields snd slots are usually read at the
     * same time). The @Contended annotation provides only rough
     * control (for good reason). Similarly for relying on fields
     * being placed in size-sorted declaration order.
     *
     * We isolate the ForkJoinPool.ctl field that otherwise causes the
     * most false-sharing misses with respect to other fields. Also,
     * ForkJoinPool fields are ordered such that fields less prone to
     * contention effects are first, offsetting those that otherwise
     * would be, while also reducing total footprint vs using
     * multiple @Contended regions, which tends to slow down
     * less-contended applications. For class WorkQueue, an
     * embedded @Contended region segregates fields most heavily
     * updated by owners from those most commonly read by stealers or
     * other management.  Initial sizing and resizing of WorkQueue
     * arrays is an even more delicate tradeoff because the best
     * strategy systematically varies across garbage collectors. Small
     * arrays are better for locality and reduce GC scan time, but
     * large arrays reduce both direct false-sharing and indirect
     * cases due to GC bookkeeping (cardmarks etc), and reduce the
     * number of resizes, which are not especially fast because they
     * require atomic transfers.  Currently, arrays are initialized to
     * be fairly small.  (Maintenance note: any changes in fields,
     * queues, or their uses, or JVM layout policies, must be
     * accompanied by re-evaluation of these placement and sizing
     * decisions.)
     *
     * Style notes
     * ===========
     *
     * Memory ordering relies mainly on atomic operations (CAS,
     * getAndSet, getAndAdd) along with moded accesses. These use
     * jdk-internal Unsafe for atomics and special memory modes,
     * rather than VarHandles, to avoid initialization dependencies in
     * other jdk components that require early parallelism.  This can
     * be awkward and ugly, but also reflects the need to control
     * outcomes across the unusual cases that arise in very racy code
     * with very few invariants. All atomic task slot updates use
     * Unsafe operations requiring offset positions, not indices, as
     * computed by method slotOffset. All fields are read into locals
     * before use, and null-checked if they are references, even if
     * they can never be null under current usages. Usually,
     * computations (held in local variables) are defined as soon as
     * logically enabled, sometimes to convince compilers that they
     * may be performed despite memory ordering constraints.  Array
     * accesses using masked indices include checks (that are always
     * true) that the array length is non-zero to avoid compilers
     * inserting more expensive traps.  This is usually done in a
     * "C"-like style of listing declarations at the heads of methods
     * or blocks, and using inline assignments on first encounter.
     * Nearly all explicit checks lead to bypass/return, not exception
     * throws, because they may legitimately arise during shutdown. A
     * few unusual loop constructions encourage (with varying
     * effectiveness) JVMs about where (not) to place safepoints.
     *
     * There is a lot of representation-level coupling among classes
     * ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and ForkJoinTask.  The
     * fields of WorkQueue maintain data structures managed by
     * ForkJoinPool, so are directly accessed.  There is little point
     * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in
     * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic
     * changes anyway. Several methods intrinsically sprawl because
     * they must accumulate sets of consistent reads of fields held in
     * local variables. Some others are artificially broken up to
     * reduce producer/consumer imbalances due to dynamic compilation.
     * There are also other coding oddities (including several
     * unnecessary-looking hoisted null checks) that help some methods
     * perform reasonably even when interpreted (not compiled).
     *
     * The order of declarations in this file is (with a few exceptions):
     * (1) Static configuration constants
     * (2) Static utility functions
     * (3) Nested (static) classes
     * (4) Fields, along with constants used when unpacking some of them
     * (5) Internal control methods
     * (6) Callbacks and other support for ForkJoinTask methods
     * (7) Exported methods
     * (8) Static block initializing statics in minimally dependent order
     *
     * Revision notes
     * ==============
     *
     * The main sources of differences from previous version are:
     *
     * * New abstract class ForkJoinTask.InterruptibleTask ensures
     *   handling of tasks submitted under the ExecutorService
     *   API are consistent with specs.
     * * Method quiescent() replaces previous quiescence-related
     *   checks, relying on versioning and sequence locking instead
     *   of ReentrantLock.
     * * Termination processing now ensures that internal data
     *   structures are maintained consistently enough while stopping
     *   to interrupt all workers and cancel all tasks. It also uses a
     *   CountDownLatch instead of a Condition for termination because
     *   of lock change.
     * * Many other changes to avoid performance regressions due
     *   to the above.

     * method, we ask users only about tradeoffs in overhead vs
     * expected throughput and its variance, rather than how finely to
     * partition tasks.
     *
     * In a steady state strict (tree-structured) computation, each
     * thread makes available for stealing enough tasks for other
     * threads to remain active. Inductively, if all threads play by
     * the same rules, each thread should make available only a
     * constant number of tasks.
     *
     * The minimum useful constant is just 1. But using a value of 1
     * would require immediate replenishment upon each steal to
     * maintain enough tasks, which is infeasible.  Further,
     * partitionings/granularities of offered tasks should minimize
     * steal rates, which in general means that threads nearer the top
     * of computation tree should generate more than those nearer the
     * bottom. In perfect steady state, each thread is at
     * approximately the same level of computation tree. However,
     * producing extra tasks amortizes the uncertainty of progress and
     * diffusion assumptions.
     *
     * So, users will want to use values larger (but not much larger)
     * than 1 to both smooth over transient shortages and hedge
     * against uneven progress; as traded off against the cost of
     * extra task overhead. We leave the user to pick a threshold
     * value to compare with the results of this call to guide
     * decisions, but recommend values such as 3.
     *
     * When all threads are active, it is on average OK to estimate
     * surplus strictly locally. In steady-state, if one thread is
     * maintaining say 2 surplus tasks, then so are others. So we can
     * just use estimated queue length.  However, this strategy alone
     * leads to serious mis-estimates in some non-steady-state
     * conditions (ramp-up, ramp-down, other stalls). We can detect
     * many of these by further considering the number of "idle"
     * threads, that are known to have zero queued tasks, so
     * compensate by a factor of (#idle/#active) threads.

     *
     * @param maximumPoolSize the maximum number of threads allowed.
     * When the maximum is reached, attempts to replace blocked
     * threads fail.  (However, because creation and termination of

     * threads not blocked by a join or {@link ManagedBlocker}.  To
     * ensure progress, when too few unblocked threads exist and
     * unexecuted tasks may exist, new threads are constructed, up to
     * the given maximumPoolSize.  For the default value, use {@code
     * 1}, that ensures liveness.  A larger value might improve
     * throughput in the presence of blocked activities, but might
     * not, due to increased overhead.  A value of zero may be
     * acceptable when submitted tasks cannot have dependencies
     * requiring additional threads.
     *
     * @param saturate if non-null, a predicate invoked upon attempts
     * to create more than the maximum total allowed threads.  By
     * default, when a thread is about to block on a join or {@link
     * ManagedBlocker}, but cannot be replaced because the
     * maximumPoolSize would be exceeded, a {@link
     * RejectedExecutionException} is thrown.  But if this predicate
     * returns {@code true}, then no exception is thrown, so the pool
     * continues to operate with fewer than the target number of
     * runnable threads, which might not ensure progress.
     *
     * @param keepAliveTime the elapsed time since last use before
     * a thread is terminated (and then later replaced if needed).
     * For the default value, use {@code 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS}.
     *
     * @param unit the time unit for the {@code keepAliveTime} argument
     *

     * Interface for extending managed parallelism for tasks running
     * in {@link ForkJoinPool}s.
     *
     * <p>A {@code ManagedBlocker} provides two methods.  Method
     * {@link #isReleasable} must return {@code true} if blocking is
     * not necessary. Method {@link #block} blocks the current thread
     * if necessary (perhaps internally invoking {@code isReleasable}
     * before actually blocking). These actions are performed by any
     * thread invoking {@link
     * ForkJoinPool#managedBlock(ManagedBlocker)}.  The unusual
     * methods in this API accommodate synchronizers that may, but
     * don't usually, block for long periods. Similarly, they allow
     * more efficient internal handling of cases in which additional
     * workers may be, but usually are not, needed to ensure
     * sufficient parallelism.  Toward this end, implementations of
     * method {@code isReleasable} must be amenable to repeated
     * invocation. Neither method is invoked after a prior invocation
     * of {@code isReleasable} or {@code block} returns {@code true}.
     *
     * <p>For example, here is a ManagedBlocker based on a
     * ReentrantLock:
     * <pre> {@code
     * class ManagedLocker implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final ReentrantLock lock;
     *   boolean hasLock = false;
     *   ManagedLocker(ReentrantLock lock) { this.lock = lock; }

     *     if (!hasLock)
     *       lock.lock();
     *     return true;
     *   }
     *   public boolean isReleasable() {
     *     return hasLock || (hasLock = lock.tryLock());
     *   }
     * }}</pre>
     *
     * <p>Here is a class that possibly blocks waiting for an
     * item on a given queue:
     * <pre> {@code
     * class QueueTaker<E> implements ManagedBlocker {
     *   final BlockingQueue<E> queue;
     *   volatile E item = null;
     *   QueueTaker(BlockingQueue<E> q) { this.queue = q; }
     *   public boolean block() throws InterruptedException {
     *     if (item == null)
     *       item = queue.take();
     *     return true;
     *   }
     *   public boolean isReleasable() {
     *     return item != null || (item = queue.poll()) != null;
     *   }
     *   public E getItem() { // call after pool.managedBlock completes
