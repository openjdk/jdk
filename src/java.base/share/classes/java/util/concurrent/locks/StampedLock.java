/**
 * A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write
 * access.  The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.
 * Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and
 * controls access with respect to a lock state; "try" versions of
 * these methods may instead return the special value zero to
 * represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion
 * methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match
 * the state of the lock. The three modes are:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 *  <li><b>Writing.</b> Method {@link #writeLock} possibly blocks
 *   waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
 *   in method {@link #unlockWrite} to release the lock. Untimed and
 *   timed versions of {@code tryWriteLock} are also provided. When
 *   the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
 *   and all optimistic read validations will fail.
 *
 *  <li><b>Reading.</b> Method {@link #readLock} possibly blocks
 *   waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
 *   used in method {@link #unlockRead} to release the lock. Untimed
 *   and timed versions of {@code tryReadLock} are also provided.
 *
 *  <li><b>Optimistic Reading.</b> Method {@link #tryOptimisticRead}
 *   returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held in
 *   write mode.  Method {@link #validate} returns true if the lock has not
 *   been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given stamp, in which
 *   case all actions prior to the most recent write lock release
 *   happen-before actions following the call to {@code tryOptimisticRead}.
 *   This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version of a
 *   read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time.  The use of
 *   optimistic read mode for short read-only code segments often reduces
 *   contention and improves throughput.  However, its use is inherently
 *   fragile.  Optimistic read sections should only read fields and hold
 *   them in local variables for later use after validation. Fields read
 *   while in optimistic read mode may be wildly inconsistent, so usage
 *   applies only when you are familiar enough with data representations to
 *   check consistency and/or repeatedly invoke method {@code validate()}.
 *   For example, such steps are typically required when first reading an
 *   object or array reference, and then accessing one of its fields,
 *   elements or methods.
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
 * conversions across the three modes. For example, method {@link
 * #tryConvertToWriteLock} attempts to "upgrade" a mode, returning
 * a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
 * mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic read mode
 * and the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
 * help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
 * retry-based designs.
 *
 * <p>StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the
 * development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on
 * knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and
 * methods they are protecting.  They are not reentrant, so locked
 * bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to
 * re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods
 * that can use or convert it).  The use of read lock modes relies on
 * the associated code sections being side-effect-free.  Unvalidated
 * optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to
 * tolerate potential inconsistencies.  Stamps use finite
 * representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a
 * valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no
 * sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without
 * use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate
 * correctly.  StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize
 * into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote
 * locking.
 *
 * <p>Like {@link java.util.concurrent.Semaphore Semaphore}, but unlike most
 * {@link Lock} implementations, StampedLocks have no notion of ownership.
 * Locks acquired in one thread can be released or converted in another.
 *
 * <p>The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently
 * prefer readers over writers or vice versa.  All "try" methods are
 * best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or
 * fairness policy. A zero return from any "try" method for acquiring
 * or converting locks does not carry any information about the state
 * of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.
 *
 * <p>Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock
 * modes, this class does not directly implement the {@link Lock} or
 * {@link ReadWriteLock} interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be
 * viewed {@link #asReadLock()}, {@link #asWriteLock()}, or {@link
 * #asReadWriteLock()} in applications requiring only the associated
 * set of functionality.
 *
 * <p><b>Memory Synchronization.</b> Methods with the effect of
 * successfully locking in any mode have the same memory
 * synchronization effects as a <em>Lock</em> action described in
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4">
 * Chapter 17 of <cite>The Java&trade; Language Specification</cite></a>.
 * Methods successfully unlocking in write mode have the same memory
 * synchronization effects as an <em>Unlock</em> action.  In optimistic
 * read usages, actions prior to the most recent write mode unlock action
 * are guaranteed to happen-before those following a tryOptimisticRead
 * only if a later validate returns true; otherwise there is no guarantee
 * that the reads between tryOptimisticRead and validate obtain a
 * consistent snapshot.
 *
 * <p><b>Sample Usage.</b> The following illustrates some usage idioms
 * in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample
 * code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are
 * not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their
 * bodies.
 *

    /*
     * Algorithmic notes:
     *
     * The design employs elements of Sequence locks
     * (as used in linux kernels; see Lameter's
     * http://www.lameter.com/gelato2005.pdf
     * and elsewhere; see
     * Boehm's http://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/2012/HPL-2012-68.html)
     * and Ordered RW locks (see Shirako et al
     * http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2312015)
     *
     * Conceptually, the primary state of the lock includes a sequence
     * number that is odd when write-locked and even otherwise.
     * However, this is offset by a reader count that is non-zero when
     * read-locked.  The read count is ignored when validating
     * "optimistic" seqlock-reader-style stamps.  Because we must use
     * a small finite number of bits (currently 7) for readers, a
     * supplementary reader overflow word is used when the number of
     * readers exceeds the count field. We do this by treating the max
     * reader count value (RBITS) as a spinlock protecting overflow
     * updates.
     *
     * Waiters use a modified form of CLH lock used in
     * AbstractQueuedSynchronizer (see its internal documentation for
     * a fuller account), where each node is tagged (field mode) as
     * either a reader or writer. Sets of waiting readers are grouped
     * (linked) under a common node (field cowait) so act as a single
     * node with respect to most CLH mechanics.  By virtue of the
     * queue structure, wait nodes need not actually carry sequence
     * numbers; we know each is greater than its predecessor.  This
     * simplifies the scheduling policy to a mainly-FIFO scheme that
     * incorporates elements of Phase-Fair locks (see Brandenburg &
     * Anderson, especially http://www.cs.unc.edu/~bbb/diss/).  In
     * particular, we use the phase-fair anti-barging rule: If an
     * incoming reader arrives while read lock is held but there is a
     * queued writer, this incoming reader is queued.  (This rule is
     * responsible for some of the complexity of method acquireRead,
     * but without it, the lock becomes highly unfair.) Method release
     * does not (and sometimes cannot) itself wake up cowaiters. This
     * is done by the primary thread, but helped by any other threads
     * with nothing better to do in methods acquireRead and
     * acquireWrite.
     *
     * These rules apply to threads actually queued. All tryLock forms
     * opportunistically try to acquire locks regardless of preference
     * rules, and so may "barge" their way in.  Randomized spinning is
     * used in the acquire methods to reduce (increasingly expensive)
     * context switching while also avoiding sustained memory
     * thrashing among many threads.  We limit spins to the head of
     * queue. If, upon wakening, a thread fails to obtain lock, and is
     * still (or becomes) the first waiting thread (which indicates
     * that some other thread barged and obtained lock), it escalates
     * spins (up to MAX_HEAD_SPINS) to reduce the likelihood of
     * continually losing to barging threads.
     *
     * Nearly all of these mechanics are carried out in methods
     * acquireWrite and acquireRead, that, as typical of such code,
     * sprawl out because actions and retries rely on consistent sets
     * of locally cached reads.
     *
     * As noted in Boehm's paper (above), sequence validation (mainly
     * method validate()) requires stricter ordering rules than apply
     * to normal volatile reads (of "state").  To force orderings of
     * reads before a validation and the validation itself in those
     * cases where this is not already forced, we use acquireFence.
     * Unlike in that paper, we allow writers to use plain writes.
     * One would not expect reorderings of such writes with the lock
     * acquisition CAS because there is a "control dependency", but it
     * is theoretically possible, so we additionally add a
     * storeStoreFence after lock acquisition CAS.
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------
     * Here's an informal proof that plain reads by _successful_
     * readers see plain writes from preceding but not following
     * writers (following Boehm and the C++ standard [atomics.fences]):
     *
     * Because of the total synchronization order of accesses to
     * volatile long state containing the sequence number, writers and
     * _successful_ readers can be globally sequenced.
     *
     * int x, y;
     *
     * Writer 1:
     * inc sequence (odd - "locked")
     * storeStoreFence();
     * x = 1; y = 2;
     * inc sequence (even - "unlocked")
     *
     * Successful Reader:
     * read sequence (even)
     * // must see writes from Writer 1 but not Writer 2
     * r1 = x; r2 = y;
     * acquireFence();
     * read sequence (even - validated unchanged)
     * // use r1 and r2
     *
     * Writer 2:
     * inc sequence (odd - "locked")
     * storeStoreFence();
     * x = 3; y = 4;
     * inc sequence (even - "unlocked")
     *
     * Visibility of writer 1's stores is normal - reader's initial
     * read of state synchronizes with writer 1's final write to state.
     * Lack of visibility of writer 2's plain writes is less obvious.
     * If reader's read of x or y saw writer 2's write, then (assuming
     * semantics of C++ fences) the storeStoreFence would "synchronize"
     * with reader's acquireFence and reader's validation read must see
     * writer 2's initial write to state and so validation must fail.
     * But making this "proof" formal and rigorous is an open problem!
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * The memory layout keeps lock state and queue pointers together
     * (normally on the same cache line). This usually works well for
     * read-mostly loads. In most other cases, the natural tendency of
     * adaptive-spin CLH locks to reduce memory contention lessens
     * motivation to further spread out contended locations, but might
     * be subject to future improvements.
