# Intrinsification
Intrinsification replaces a candidate method's body, bytecode or native, with
handwritten platform assembly and/or compiler IR.  (In `library_call.cpp`,
`LibraryCallKit::try_to_inline` checks if an intrinsic is available and
applicable at a given call site.)  Many Java library methods have properties
that cannot be deduced by the compiler for optimization, or can utilize specific
hardware instructions not modeled by the compiler IR, making intrinsics necessary.

During execution, intrinsification may happen and may be rolled back at any
moment; this loading and unloading process may happen zero to many times.
For example, the bytecode of a candidate method may be executed by lower
compilation tiers of VM execution, while higher compilation tiers may replace
the bytecode with specialized assembly code and/or compiler IR.  Therefore,
intrinsic implementors must ensure that non-bytecode execution has the same
results as execution of the actual Java code in all application contexts
(given that the assumptions on the arguments hold).

A candidate method should contain a minimal piece of Java code that should be
replaced by an intrinsic wholesale.  The backing intrinsic is (in the common
case) **unsafe** - it may not perform checks, but instead makes
assumptions on its arguments that type safety is ensured by callers.  These
assumptions must be clearly documented on the candidate methods, and the
callers are fully responsible for preventing any kind of type safety
violation.  As long as these assumptions hold, readers can simply refer to
the candidate method's Java code body for program behaviors.

### Validation
To ensure type safety, candidate methods are typically private, and access to
them are encapsulated by more accessible methods that perform argument
validations.  Any validation must be done on values that are exclusively
accessed by the current thread: shared fields must be read into local
variables, and shared arrays must be copied to an exclusive copy, to ensure
each shared location (a field or an array component) is accessed at most once.
If a shared location is read multiple times for check and for use, race
conditions may cause two reads to produce distinct values, known as TOCTOU
(time of check and time of use), and the read for use may produce an illegal
value.  Finally, the thread-exclusive validated values are passed to the
candidate method.
