/**
 * A grouping of threads that typically run closely related tasks. Threads started
 * in a flock remain in the flock until they terminate.
 *
 * <p> ThreadFlock defines the {@link #open(String) open} method to open a new flock,
 * the {@link #start(Thread) start} method to start a thread in the flock, and the
 * {@link #close() close} method to close the flock. The {@code close} waits for all
 * threads in the flock to finish. The {@link #awaitAll() awaitAll} method may be used
 * to wait for all threads to finish without closing the flock. The {@link #wakeup()}
 * method will cause {@code awaitAll} method to complete early, which can be used to
 * support cancellation in higher-level APIs. ThreadFlock also defines the {@link
 * #shutdown() shutdown} method to prevent new threads from starting while allowing
 * existing threads in the flock to continue.
 *
 * <p> Thread flocks are intended to be used in a <em>structured manner</em>. The
 * thread that opens a new flock is the {@link #owner() owner}. The owner closes the
 * flock when done, failure to do so may result in a resource leak. The {@code open}
 * and {@code close} should be matched to avoid closing an <em>enclosing</em> flock
 * while a <em>nested</em> flock is open. A ThreadFlock can be used with the
 * try-with-resources construct if required but more likely, the close method of a
 * higher-level API that implements {@link AutoCloseable} will close the flock.
 *
 * <p> Thread flocks are conceptually nodes in a tree. A thread {@code T} started in
 * flock "A" may itself open a new flock "B", implicitly forming a tree where flock
 * "A" is the parent of flock "B". When nested, say where thread {@code T} opens
 * flock "B" and then invokes a method that opens flock "C", then the enclosing
 * flock "B" is conceptually the parent of the nested flock "C". ThreadFlock does
 * not define APIs that exposes the tree structure. It does define the {@link
 * #containsThread(Thread) containsThread} method to test if a flock contains a
 * thread, a test that is equivalent to testing membership of flocks in the tree.
 * The {@code start} and {@code shutdown} methods are confined to the flock
 * owner or threads contained in the flock. The confinement check is equivalent to
 * invoking the {@code containsThread} method to test if the caller is contained
 * in the flock.
 *
 * <p> Unless otherwise specified, passing a {@code null} argument to a method
 * in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException} to be thrown.
