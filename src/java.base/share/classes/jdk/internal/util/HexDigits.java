     * Efficiently converts 8 hexadecimal digits to their ASCII representation using SIMD-style vector operations.
     * This method processes multiple digits in parallel by treating a long value as eight 8-bit lanes,
     * achieving significantly better performance compared to traditional loop-based conversion.
     *
     * <p>The conversion algorithm works as follows:
     * <pre>
     * 1. Input expansion: Each 4-bit hex digit is expanded to 8 bits
     * 2. Vector processing:
     *    - Add 6 to each digit: triggers carry flag for a-f digits
     *    - Mask with 0x10 pattern to isolate carry flags
     *    - Calculate ASCII adjustment: (carry << 1) + (carry >> 1) - (carry >> 4)
     *    - Add ASCII '0' base (0x30) and original value
     * 3. Byte order adjustment for final output
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Performance characteristics:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Processes 8 digits in parallel using vector operations
     *   <li>Avoids branching and loops completely
     *   <li>Uses only integer arithmetic and bit operations
     *   <li>Constant time execution regardless of input values
     * </ul>
     *
     * <p>ASCII conversion mapping:
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Digits 0-9 → ASCII '0'-'9' (0x30-0x39)
     *   <li>Digits a-f → ASCII 'a'-'f' (0x61-0x66)
     * </ul>
     *
     * @param input A long containing 8 hex digits (each digit must be 0-15)
     * @return A long containing 8 ASCII bytes representing the hex digits
     *
     * @implNote The implementation leverages CPU vector processing capabilities through
     *           long integer operations. The algorithm is based on the observation that
     *           ASCII hex digits have a specific pattern that can be computed efficiently
     *           using carry flag manipulation.
     *
     * @example
     * <pre>
     * Input:  0xABCDEF01
     * Output: 3130666564636261 ('1','0','f','e','d','c','b','a' in ASCII)
