/**
 * Labels are created with a parent context, which is either a code attribute
 * or a code builder.  A label originating in a code attribute context may be
 * reused in a code builder context, but only labels from a single code
 * attribute may be reused by a single code builder.  Mappings to and from
 * BCI are the responsibility of the context in which it is used; a single
 * word of mutable state is provided, for the exclusive use of the owning
 * context.
 *
 * In practice, this means that labels created in a code attribute can simply
 * store the BCI in the state on creation, and labels created in in a code
 * builder can store the BCI in the state when the label is eventually set; if
 * a code attribute label is reused in a builder, the original BCI can be used
 * as an index into an array.
