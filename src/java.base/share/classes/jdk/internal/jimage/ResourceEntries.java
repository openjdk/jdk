 * <p>This API ignores the {@code previewMode} of the {@link ImageReader} from

 * or packages entries (i.e. {@code "/packages/..."}).

 *
 * It is used internally in the JDK to implement jimage/jrtfs access,
 * but also compiled and delivered as part of the jrtfs.jar to support access
 * to the jimage file provided by the shipped JDK by tools running on JDK 8.
