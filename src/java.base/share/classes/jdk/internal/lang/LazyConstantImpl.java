    // establish a happens-before (HB) relation between load and store operations. Every
    // implementation of a method defined in the interface `LazyConstant` except
    // `equals()` starts with a load of the `constant` field using acquire semantics.
    //
    // If the underlying supplier was guaranteed to always create a new object,
    // a fence after creation and subsequent plain loads would suffice to ensure
    // new objects' state are always correctly observed. However, no such restriction is
    // imposed on the underlying supplier. Hence, the docs state there should be an
    // HB relation meaning we will have to pay a price (on certain platforms) on every
    // `get()` operation that is not constant-folded.
