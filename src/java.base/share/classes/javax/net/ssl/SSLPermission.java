/**
 * This class is for various network permissions.
 * An SSLPermission contains a name (also referred to as a "target name") but
 * no actions list; you either have the named permission
 * or you don't.
 * <P>
 * The target name is the name of the network permission. The naming
 * convention follows the  hierarchical property naming convention.
 * Also, an asterisk
 * may appear at the end of the name, following a ".", or by itself, to
 * signify a wildcard match. For example: "foo.*" and "*" signify a wildcard
 * match, while "*foo" and "a*b" do not.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * This permission cannot be used for controlling access to resources
 * as the Security Manager is no longer supported.
