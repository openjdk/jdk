/**
 * This class defines the <i>Service Provider Interface</i> (<b>SPI</b>)
 * for the {@code Cipher} class.
 * All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 * cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 * of a particular cipher algorithm.
 *
 * <p>In order to create an instance of {@code Cipher}, which
 * encapsulates an instance of this {@code CipherSpi} class, an
 * application calls one of the
 * {@link Cipher#getInstance(java.lang.String) getInstance}
 * factory methods of the
 * {@link Cipher Cipher} engine class and specifies the requested
 * <i>transformation</i>.
 * Optionally, the application may also specify the name of a provider.
 *
 * <p>A <i>transformation</i> is a string that describes the operation (or
 * set of operations) to be performed on the given input, to produce some
 * output. A transformation always includes the name of a cryptographic
 * algorithm (e.g., <i>AES</i>), and may be followed by a feedback mode and
 * padding scheme.
 *
 * <p> A transformation is of the form:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>"<i>algorithm/mode/padding</i>" or
 *
 * <li>"<i>algorithm</i>"
 * </ul>
 *
 * <P> (in the latter case,
 * provider-specific default values for the mode and padding scheme are used).
 * For example, the following is a valid transformation:
 *
 * <pre>
 *     Cipher c = Cipher.getInstance("<i>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</i>");
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>A provider may supply a separate class for each combination
 * of <i>algorithm/mode/padding</i>, or may decide to provide more generic
 * classes representing sub-transformations corresponding to
 * <i>algorithm</i> or <i>algorithm/mode</i> or <i>algorithm//padding</i>
 * (note the double slashes),
 * in which case the requested mode and/or padding are set automatically by
 * the {@code getInstance} methods of {@code Cipher}, which invoke
 * the {@link #engineSetMode(java.lang.String) engineSetMode} and
 * {@link #engineSetPadding(java.lang.String) engineSetPadding}
 * methods of the provider's subclass of {@code CipherSpi}.
 *
 * <p>A {@code Cipher} property in a provider master class may have one of
 * the following formats:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with
 *     // pluggable mode and padding
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>algName</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" in the
 *     // specified "mode", with pluggable padding
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>algName/mode</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
 *     // specified "padding", with pluggable mode
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>algName//padding</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     // provider's subclass of "CipherSpi" implements "algName" with the
 *     // specified "mode" and "padding"
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>algName/mode/padding</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>For example, a provider may supply a subclass of {@code CipherSpi}
 * that implements <i>AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding</i>, one that implements
 * <i>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</i>, one that implements
 * <i>AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding</i>, and yet another one that implements
 * <i>AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding</i>. That provider would have the following
 * {@code Cipher} properties in its master class:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>AES/ECB/PKCS5Padding</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>AES/CBC/PKCS5Padding</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>AES/CFB/PKCS5Padding</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>AES/OFB/PKCS5Padding</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Another provider may implement a class for each of the above modes
 * (i.e., one class for <i>ECB</i>, one for <i>CBC</i>, one for <i>CFB</i>,
 * and one for <i>OFB</i>), one class for <i>PKCS5Padding</i>,
 * and a generic <i>AES</i> class that subclasses from {@code CipherSpi}.
 * That provider would have the following
 * {@code Cipher} properties in its master class:
 *
 * <ul>
 *
 * <li>
 * <pre>
 *     {@code Cipher.}<i>AES</i>
 * </pre>
 *
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@code getInstance} factory method of the {@code Cipher}
 * engine class follows these rules in order to instantiate a provider's
 * implementation of {@code CipherSpi} for a
 * transformation of the form "<i>algorithm</i>":
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Check if the provider has registered a subclass of {@code CipherSpi}
 * for the specified "<i>algorithm</i>".
 * <p>If the answer is YES, instantiate this
 * class, for whose mode and padding scheme default values (as supplied by
 * the provider) are used.
 * <p>If the answer is NO, throw a {@code NoSuchAlgorithmException}
 * exception.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>The {@code getInstance} factory method of the {@code Cipher}
 * engine class follows these rules in order to instantiate a provider's
 * implementation of {@code CipherSpi} for a
 * transformation of the form "<i>algorithm/mode/padding</i>":
 *
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Check if the provider has registered a subclass of {@code CipherSpi}
 * for the specified "<i>algorithm/mode/padding</i>" transformation.
 * <p>If the answer is YES, instantiate it.
 * <p>If the answer is NO, go to the next step.
 * <li>
 * Check if the provider has registered a subclass of {@code CipherSpi}
 * for the sub-transformation "<i>algorithm/mode</i>".
 * <p>If the answer is YES, instantiate it, and call
 * {@code engineSetPadding(<i>padding</i>)} on the new instance.
 * <p>If the answer is NO, go to the next step.
 * <li>
 * Check if the provider has registered a subclass of {@code CipherSpi}
 * for the sub-transformation "<i>algorithm//padding</i>" (note the double
 * slashes).
 * <p>If the answer is YES, instantiate it, and call
 * {@code engineSetMode(<i>mode</i>)} on the new instance.
 * <p>If the answer is NO, go to the next step.
 * <li>
 * Check if the provider has registered a subclass of {@code CipherSpi}
 * for the sub-transformation "<i>algorithm</i>".
 * <p>If the answer is YES, instantiate it, and call
