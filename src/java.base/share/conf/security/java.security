#
# This is the "master security properties file".
#
# An alternate java.security properties file may be specified
# from the command line via the system property
#
#    -Djava.security.properties=<URL>
#
# This properties file appends to the master security properties file.
# If both properties files specify values for the same key, the value
# from the command-line properties file is selected, as it is the last
# one loaded.
#
# Also, if you specify
#
#    -Djava.security.properties==<URL> (2 equals),
#
# then that properties file completely overrides the master security
# properties file.
#
# To disable the ability to specify an additional properties file from
# the command line, set the key security.overridePropertiesFile
# to false in the master security properties file. It is set to true
# by default.
#
# If this properties file fails to load, the JDK implementation will throw
# an unspecified error when initializing the java.security.Security class.
# Properties in this file are typically parsed only once. If any of the
# properties are modified, applications should be restarted to ensure the
# changes are properly reflected.
#
# The special "include" property can be defined one or multiple times with
# a filesystem path value. The effect of each definition is to include a
# referred security properties file inline, adding all its properties.
# Security properties defined before an include statement may be overridden
# by properties in the included file, if their names match. Conversely,
# properties defined after an include statement may override properties in
# the included file.
#
# Included files, as well as files pointed to by java.security.properties,
# can include other files recursively. Paths may be absolute or relative.
# Each relative path is resolved against the base file containing its
# "include" definition, if local. Paths may contain system properties for
# expansion in the form of ${system.property}. If a system property does
# not have a value, it expands to the empty string.
#
# An error will be thrown if a file cannot be included. This may happen
# if the file cannot be resolved, does not exist, is a directory, there are
# insufficient permissions to read it, it is recursively included more than
# once, or for any other reason. For a secure JDK configuration, it is
# important to review OS write permissions assigned to any file included.
#
# Examples:
#   1) include ${java.home}/conf/security/extra.security
#   2) include extra.security
#   3) include ${java.home}/conf/security/profile${SecurityProfile}.security
#

# In this file, various security properties are set for use by
# java.security classes. This is where users can statically register
# Cryptography Package Providers ("providers" for short). The term
# "provider" refers to a package or set of packages that supply a
# concrete implementation of a subset of the cryptography aspects of
# the Java Security API. A provider may, for example, implement one or
# more digital signature algorithms or message digest algorithms.
#
# Each provider must implement a subclass of the Provider class.
# To register a provider in this master security properties file,
# specify the provider and priority in the format
#
#    security.provider.<n>=<provName | className>
#
# This declares a provider, and specifies its preference
# order n. The preference order is the order in which providers are
# searched for requested algorithms (when no specific provider is
# requested). The order is 1-based; 1 is the most preferred, followed
# by 2, and so on.
#
# <provName> must specify the name of the Provider as passed to its super
# class java.security.Provider constructor. This is for providers loaded
# through the ServiceLoader mechanism.
#
# <className> must specify the subclass of the Provider class whose
# constructor sets the values of various properties that are required
# for the Java Security API to look up the algorithms or other
# facilities implemented by the provider. This is for providers loaded
# through classpath.
#
# Note: Providers can be dynamically registered instead by calls to
# either the addProvider or insertProviderAt method in the Security
# class.

#
# The property is a comma-separated list of serviceType.algorithm:provider

# The algorithm is the standard algorithm name or transformation.
# Transformations can be specified in their full standard name

# The provider is the name of the provider. Any provider that does not
# also appear in the registered list will be ignored.
#
# There is a special serviceType for this property only to group a set of

#
# On Unix-like systems (for example, Linux/MacOS), the

#     NativePRNG:
#         a default value of /dev/random will be used.  If neither
#         are available, the implementation will be disabled.
#         "file" is the only currently supported protocol type.
#
#     SHA1PRNG and DRBG:
#         the traditional system/thread activity algorithm will be used.
#
# The entropy gathering device can also be specified with the System
# property "java.security.egd". For example:
#
#   % java -Djava.security.egd=file:/dev/random MainClass
#
# Specifying this System property will override the
# "securerandom.source" Security property.

# Properties to configure OCSP for certificate revocation checking
#

# Enable OCSP
#
# By default, OCSP is not used for certificate revocation checking.
# This property enables the use of OCSP when set to the value "true".
#
# NOTE: SocketPermission is required to connect to an OCSP responder.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.enable=true

#
# Location of the OCSP responder
#
# By default, the location of the OCSP responder is determined implicitly
# from the certificate being validated. This property explicitly specifies
# the location of the OCSP responder. The property is used when the
# Authority Information Access extension (defined in RFC 5280) is absent
# from the certificate or when it requires overriding.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderURL=http://ocsp.example.net:80

#
# Subject name of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in
# the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. In cases where
# the subject name alone is not sufficient to uniquely identify the certificate
# then both the "ocsp.responderCertIssuerName" and
# "ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber" properties must be used instead. When this
# property is set then those two properties are ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertSubjectName=CN=OCSP Responder, O=XYZ Corp

#
# Issuer name of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# distinguished name (defined in RFC 2253) which identifies a certificate in
# the set of certificates supplied during cert path validation. When this
# property is set then the "ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber" property must also
# be set. When the "ocsp.responderCertSubjectName" property is set then this
# property is ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertIssuerName=CN=Enterprise CA, O=XYZ Corp

#
# Serial number of the OCSP responder's certificate
#
# By default, the certificate of the OCSP responder is that of the issuer
# of the certificate being validated. This property identifies the certificate
# of the OCSP responder when the default does not apply. Its value is a string
# of hexadecimal digits (colon or space separators may be present) which
# identifies a certificate in the set of certificates supplied during cert path
# validation. When this property is set then the "ocsp.responderCertIssuerName"
# property must also be set. When the "ocsp.responderCertSubjectName" property
# is set then this property is ignored.
#
# Example,
#   ocsp.responderCertSerialNumber=2A:FF:00

#
# Policy for failed Kerberos KDC lookups:
#
# When a KDC is unavailable (network error, service failure, etc), it is
# put inside a secondary list and accessed less often for future requests. The
# value (case-insensitive) for this policy can be:
#
# tryLast
#    KDCs in the secondary list are always tried after those not on the list.
#
# tryLess[:max_retries,timeout]
#    KDCs in the secondary list are still tried by their order in the
#    configuration, but with smaller max_retries and timeout values.
#    max_retries and timeout are optional numerical parameters (default 1 and
#    5000, which means once and 5 seconds). Please note that if any of the
#    values defined here are more than what is defined in krb5.conf, it will be
#    ignored.
#
# Whenever a KDC is detected as available, it is removed from the secondary
# list. The secondary list is reset when krb5.conf is reloaded. You can add
# refreshKrb5Config=true to a JAAS configuration file so that krb5.conf is
# reloaded whenever a JAAS authentication is attempted.
#
# Example,
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast
#   krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLess:2,2000
#
krb5.kdc.bad.policy = tryLast

#
# Kerberos cross-realm referrals (RFC 6806)
#
# OpenJDK's Kerberos client supports cross-realm referrals as defined in
# RFC 6806. This allows to setup more dynamic environments in which clients
# do not need to know in advance how to reach the realm of a target principal
# (either a user or service).
#
# When a client issues an AS or a TGS request, the "canonicalize" option
# is set to announce support of this feature. A KDC server may fulfill the
# request or reply referring the client to a different one. If referred,
# the client will issue a new request and the cycle repeats.
#
# In addition to referrals, the "canonicalize" option allows the KDC server
# to change the client name in response to an AS request. For security reasons,
# RFC 6806 (section 11) FAST scheme is enforced.
#
# Disable Kerberos cross-realm referrals. Value may be overwritten with a
# System property (-Dsun.security.krb5.disableReferrals).
sun.security.krb5.disableReferrals=false

# Maximum number of AS or TGS referrals to avoid infinite loops. Value may

#
# Algorithm restrictions for certification path (CertPath) processing
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
# for certification path building and validation.  For example, "MD2" is
# generally no longer considered to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section
# describes the mechanism for disabling algorithms based on algorithm name
# and/or key length.  This includes algorithms used in certificates, as well
# as revocation information such as CRLs and signed OCSP Responses.
# The syntax of the disabled algorithm string is described as follows:
#   DisabledAlgorithms:
#       " DisabledAlgorithm { , DisabledAlgorithm } "
#
#   DisabledAlgorithm:
#       AlgorithmName [Constraint] { '&' Constraint } | IncludeProperty
#
#   AlgorithmName:
#       (see below)
#
#   Constraint:
#       KeySizeConstraint | CAConstraint | DenyAfterConstraint |
#       UsageConstraint
#
#   KeySizeConstraint:
#       keySize Operator KeyLength
#
#   Operator:
#       <= | < | == | != | >= | >
#
#   KeyLength:
#       Integer value of the algorithm's key length in bits
#
#   CAConstraint:
#       jdkCA
#
#   DenyAfterConstraint:
#       denyAfter YYYY-MM-DD
#
#   UsageConstraint:
#       usage UsageType { UsageType }
#
#   UsageType:
#       TLSServer | TLSClient | SignedJAR
#
#   IncludeProperty:
#       include <security property>
#
# The "AlgorithmName" is the standard algorithm name of the disabled
# algorithm. See the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification
# for information about Standard Algorithm Names.  Matching is
# performed using a case-insensitive sub-element matching rule.  (For
# example, in "SHA1withECDSA" the sub-elements are "SHA1" for hashing and
# "ECDSA" for signatures.)  If the assertion "AlgorithmName" is a
# sub-element of the certificate algorithm name, the algorithm will be
# rejected during certification path building and validation.  For example,
# the assertion algorithm name "DSA" will disable all certificate algorithms
# that rely on DSA, such as NONEwithDSA, SHA1withDSA.  However, the assertion
# will not disable algorithms related to "ECDSA".
#
# The "IncludeProperty" allows a implementation-defined security property that
# can be included in the disabledAlgorithms properties.  These properties are
# to help manage common actions easier across multiple disabledAlgorithm
# properties.
# There is one defined security property:  jdk.disabled.namedCurves
# See the property for more specific details.
#
#
# A "Constraint" defines restrictions on the keys and/or certificates for
# a specified AlgorithmName:
#
#   KeySizeConstraint:
#     keySize Operator KeyLength
#       The constraint requires a key of a valid size range if the
#       "AlgorithmName" is of a key algorithm.  The "KeyLength" indicates
#       the key size specified in number of bits.  For example,
#       "RSA keySize <= 1024" indicates that any RSA key with key size less
#       than or equal to 1024 bits should be disabled, and
#       "RSA keySize < 1024, RSA keySize > 2048" indicates that any RSA key
#       with key size less than 1024 or greater than 2048 should be disabled.
#       This constraint is only used on algorithms that have a key size.
#
#   CAConstraint:
#     jdkCA
#       This constraint prohibits the specified algorithm only if the
#       algorithm is used in a certificate chain that terminates at a marked
#       trust anchor in the lib/security/cacerts keystore.  If the jdkCA
#       constraint is not set, then all chains using the specified algorithm
#       are restricted.  jdkCA may only be used once in a DisabledAlgorithm
#       expression.
#       Example:  To apply this constraint to SHA-1 certificates, include
#       the following:  "SHA1 jdkCA"
#
#   DenyAfterConstraint:
#     denyAfter YYYY-MM-DD
#       This constraint prohibits a certificate with the specified algorithm
#       from being used after the date regardless of the certificate's
#       validity.  JAR files that are signed and timestamped before the
#       constraint date with certificates containing the disabled algorithm
#       will not be restricted.  The date is processed in the UTC timezone.
#       This constraint can only be used once in a DisabledAlgorithm
#       expression.
#       Example:  To deny usage of RSA 2048 bit certificates after Feb 3 2020,
#       use the following:  "RSA keySize == 2048 & denyAfter 2020-02-03"
#
#   UsageConstraint:
#     usage UsageType { UsageType }
#       This constraint prohibits the specified algorithm for
#       a specified UsageType.  This should be used when disabling an algorithm
#       for all usages is not practical. 'TLSServer' restricts the algorithm
#       in TLS server certificate chains when server authentication is
#       performed. 'TLSClient' restricts the algorithm in TLS client
#       certificate chains when client authentication is performed.
#       'SignedJAR' constrains use of certificates in signed jar files.
#       The usage type follows the keyword and more than one usage type can
#       be specified with a whitespace delimiter.
#       Example:  "SHA1 usage TLSServer TLSClient"
#
# When an algorithm must satisfy more than one constraint, it must be
# delimited by an ampersand '&'.  For example, to restrict certificates in a
# chain that terminate at a distribution provided trust anchor and contain
# RSA keys that are less than or equal to 1024 bits, add the following
# constraint:  "RSA keySize <= 1024 & jdkCA".
#
# All DisabledAlgorithms expressions are processed in the order defined in the
# property.  This requires lower keysize constraints to be specified
# before larger keysize constraints of the same algorithm.  For example:
# "RSA keySize < 1024 & jdkCA, RSA keySize < 2048".
#
# Note: The algorithm restrictions do not apply to trust anchors or
# self-signed certificates.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by Oracle's PKIX implementation. It
# is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# Example:
#   jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, DSA, RSA keySize < 2048
#
#
jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, SHA1 jdkCA & usage TLSServer, \
    RSA keySize < 1024, DSA keySize < 1024, EC keySize < 224, \
    SHA1 usage SignedJAR & denyAfter 2019-01-01

#
# Legacy cryptographic algorithms and key lengths.
#
# In some environments, a certain algorithm or key length may be undesirable.
#
# Tools such as keytool and jarsigner may emit warnings when these legacy
# algorithms are used. See the man pages for those tools for more information.
#
# The syntax is the same as the "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms" and
# "jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms" security properties.

#
# Algorithm restrictions for Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security
# (SSL/TLS/DTLS) processing
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms or key lengths may be undesirable
# when using SSL/TLS/DTLS.  This section describes the mechanism for disabling
# algorithms during SSL/TLS/DTLS security parameters negotiation, including
# protocol version negotiation, cipher suites selection, named groups
# selection, signature schemes selection, peer authentication and key
# exchange mechanisms.
#
# Disabled algorithms will not be negotiated for SSL/TLS connections, even
# if they are enabled explicitly in an application.
#
# For PKI-based peer authentication and key exchange mechanisms, this list
# of disabled algorithms will also be checked during certification path
# building and validation, including algorithms used in certificates, as
# well as revocation information such as CRLs and signed OCSP Responses.
# This is in addition to the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms property above.
#
# See the specification of "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms" for the
# syntax of the disabled algorithm string.
#
# Additional TLS-specific syntax supported by this property:
#
#   - TLS cipher suites can be disabled with this property using one or more
#     "*" wildcard characters. For example, "TLS_RSA_*" disables all cipher
#     suites that start with "TLS_RSA_". Only cipher suites starting with
#     "TLS_" are allowed to have wildcard characters.
#
#   - TLS protocol specific usage constraints are supported by this property:
#
#     UsageConstraint:
#         usage UsageType { UsageType }
#
#     UsageType:
#         HandshakeSignature | CertificateSignature
#
#     HandshakeSignature restricts the use of the algorithm in TLS handshake
#     signatures. CertificateSignature restricts the use of the algorithm in
#     certificate signatures. An algorithm with this constraint cannot include
#     other usage types defined in the jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms
#     property. The usage type follows the keyword and more than one usage type
#     can be specified with a whitespace delimiter.
#     Example: "rsa_pkcs1_sha1 usage HandshakeSignature"
#
# Note: The algorithm restrictions do not apply to trust anchors or
# self-signed certificates.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.

# Algorithm restrictions for Java Crypto API services
#
# In some environments, certain algorithms may be undesirable for certain
# cryptographic services. For example, "MD2" is generally no longer considered
# to be a secure hash algorithm.  This section describes the mechanism for
# disabling algorithms at the JCA/JCE level based on service name and algorithm
# name.
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the
# security property value defined here.
#
# The syntax of the disabled services string is described as follows:
#       "DisabledService {, DisabledService}"
#
#   DisabledService:
#       Service.AlgorithmName
#
# Service:  (one of the following, more services may be added later)
#     Cipher | KeyStore | MessageDigest | Signature
#
#   AlgorithmName:
#       (see below)
#
# The "AlgorithmName" is the standard algorithm name of the disabled
# service. See the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification
# for information about Standard Algorithm Names.  Matching is
# performed using a case-insensitive exact matching rule. For Cipher service,
# its algorithm is the transformation string.
#
# Note: If the property value contains entries with invalid syntax or
# unsupported services at the time of checking, an ExceptionInInitializerError
# with a cause of IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.
#
# Note: The restriction is applied in the various getInstance(...) methods
# of the supported Service classes, i.e. Cipher, KeyStore, MessageDigest,
# and Signature. If the algorithm is disabled, a NoSuchAlgorithmException will
# be thrown by the getInstance methods of Cipher, MessageDigest, and Signature
# and a KeyStoreException by the getInstance methods of KeyStore.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.

# Legacy algorithms for Secure Socket Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS)
# processing in JSSE implementation.
#
# In some environments, a certain algorithm may be undesirable but it
# cannot be disabled because of its use in legacy applications.  Legacy
# algorithms may still be supported, but applications should not use them
# as the security strength of legacy algorithms are usually not strong enough
# in practice.
#
# During SSL/TLS security parameters negotiation, legacy algorithms will
# not be negotiated unless there are no other candidates.
#
# The syntax of the legacy algorithms string is described as this Java
# BNF-style:
#   LegacyAlgorithms:
#       " LegacyAlgorithm { , LegacyAlgorithm } "
#
#   LegacyAlgorithm:
#       AlgorithmName (standard JSSE algorithm name)
#
# See the specification of security property "jdk.certpath.disabledAlgorithms"
# for the syntax and description of the "AlgorithmName" notation.
#
# Per SSL/TLS specifications, cipher suites have the form:
#       SSL_KeyExchangeAlg_WITH_CipherAlg_MacAlg
# or
#       TLS_KeyExchangeAlg_WITH_CipherAlg_MacAlg
#
# For example, the cipher suite TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA uses RSA as the
# key exchange algorithm, AES_128_CBC (128 bits AES cipher algorithm in CBC
# mode) as the cipher (encryption) algorithm, and SHA-1 as the message digest
# algorithm for HMAC.
#
# The LegacyAlgorithm can be one of the following standard algorithm names:
#     1. JSSE cipher suite name, e.g., TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA
#     2. JSSE key exchange algorithm name, e.g., RSA
#     3. JSSE cipher (encryption) algorithm name, e.g., AES_128_CBC
#     4. JSSE message digest algorithm name, e.g., SHA
#
# See SSL/TLS specifications and the Java Security Standard Algorithm Names
# Specification for information about the algorithm names.
#
# Note: If a legacy algorithm is also restricted through the
# jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms property or the
# java.security.AlgorithmConstraints API (See
# javax.net.ssl.SSLParameters.setAlgorithmConstraints()),
# then the algorithm is completely disabled and will not be negotiated.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
# There is no guarantee the property will continue to exist or be of the
# same syntax in future releases.

#
# In traditional SSL/TLS/DTLS connections where finite field DHE parameters
# negotiation mechanism is not used, the server offers the client group
# parameters, base generator g and prime modulus p, for DHE key exchange.
# It is recommended to use dynamic group parameters.  This property defines
# a mechanism that allows you to specify custom group parameters.
#
# The syntax of this property string is described as this Java BNF-style:

#
#   HexadecimalDigit: one of
#       0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F a b c d e f
#
# Whitespace characters are ignored.
#
# The "DefinedDHEParameters" defines the custom group parameters, prime
# modulus p and base generator g, for a particular size of prime modulus p.
# The "DHEPrimeModulus" defines the hexadecimal prime modulus p, and the
# "DHEBaseGenerator" defines the hexadecimal base generator g of a group
# parameter.  It is recommended to use safe primes for the custom group
# parameters.
#
# If this property is not defined or the value is empty, the underlying JSSE
# provider's default group parameter is used for each connection.
#
# If the property value does not follow the grammar, or a particular group
# parameter is not valid, the connection will fall back and use the
# underlying JSSE provider's default group parameter.

# Cryptographic Jurisdiction Policy defaults
#
# Import and export control rules on cryptographic software vary from
# country to country.  By default, Java provides two different sets of
# cryptographic policy files[1]:
#
#     unlimited:  These policy files contain no restrictions on cryptographic
#                 strengths or algorithms
#
#     limited:    These policy files contain more restricted cryptographic
#                 strengths
#
# The default setting is determined by the value of the "crypto.policy"
# Security property below. If your country or usage requires the
# traditional restrictive policy, the "limited" Java cryptographic
# policy is still available and may be appropriate for your environment.
#
# If you have restrictions that do not fit either use case mentioned
# above, Java provides the capability to customize these policy files.
# The "crypto.policy" security property points to a subdirectory
# within <java-home>/conf/security/policy/ which can be customized.
# Please see the <java-home>/conf/security/policy/README.txt file or consult
# the Java Security Guide/JCA documentation for more information.
#
# YOU ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT YOUR EXPORT/IMPORT CONTROL COUNSEL OR ATTORNEY
# TO DETERMINE THE EXACT REQUIREMENTS.

# Deserialization JVM-wide filter factory
#
# A filter factory class name is used to configure the JVM-wide filter factory.
# The class must be public, must have a public zero-argument constructor, implement the
# java.util.function.BinaryOperator<java.io.ObjectInputFilter> interface, provide its
# implementation and be accessible via the application class loader.
# A builtin filter factory is used if no filter factory is defined.
# See java.io.ObjectInputFilter.Config for more information.
#
# If the system property jdk.serialFilterFactory is also specified, it supersedes
# the security property value defined here.
#
#jdk.serialFilterFactory=<classname>

#
# Deserialization JVM-wide filter
#
# A filter, if configured, is used by the filter factory to provide the filter used by
# java.io.ObjectInputStream during deserialization to check the contents of the stream.
# A filter is configured as a sequence of patterns, each pattern is either
# matched against the name of a class in the stream or defines a limit.
# Patterns are separated by ";" (semicolon).
# Whitespace is significant and is considered part of the pattern.
#
# If the system property jdk.serialFilter is also specified, it supersedes
# the security property value defined here.
#
# If a pattern includes a "=", it sets a limit.
# If a limit appears more than once the last value is used.
# Limits are checked before classes regardless of the order in the
# sequence of patterns.
# If any of the limits are exceeded, the filter status is REJECTED.
#
#   maxdepth=value - the maximum depth of a graph
#   maxrefs=value  - the maximum number of internal references
#   maxbytes=value - the maximum number of bytes in the input stream
#   maxarray=value - the maximum array length allowed
#
# Other patterns, from left to right, match the class or package name as
# returned from Class.getName.
# If the class is an array type, the class or package to be matched is the
# element type.
# Arrays of any number of dimensions are treated the same as the element type.
# For example, a pattern of "!example.Foo", rejects creation of any instance or
# array of example.Foo.
#
# If the pattern starts with "!", the status is REJECTED if the remaining
# pattern is matched; otherwise the status is ALLOWED if the pattern matches.
# If the pattern contains "/", the non-empty prefix up to the "/" is the
# module name;
#   if the module name matches the module name of the class then
#   the remaining pattern is matched with the class name.
#   If there is no "/", the module name is not compared.
# If the pattern ends with ".**" it matches any class in the package and all
# subpackages.
# If the pattern ends with ".*" it matches any class in the package.
# If the pattern ends with "*", it matches any class with the pattern as a
# prefix.
# If the pattern is equal to the class name, it matches.
# Otherwise, the status is UNDECIDED.

#
# RMI Registry Serial Filter
#
# The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter.
# This filter can override the builtin filter if additional types need to be
# allowed or rejected from the RMI Registry or to decrease limits but not
# to increase limits.
# If the limits (maxdepth, maxrefs, or maxbytes) are exceeded, the object is rejected.
#
# Each non-array type is allowed or rejected if it matches one of the patterns,
# evaluated from left to right, and is otherwise allowed. Arrays of any
# component type, including subarrays and arrays of primitives, are allowed.
#
# Array construction of any component type, including subarrays and arrays of
# primitives, are allowed unless the length is greater than the maxarray limit.
# The filter is applied to each array element.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# The built-in filter allows subclasses of allowed classes and
# can approximately be represented as the pattern:
#
#sun.rmi.registry.registryFilter=\
#    maxarray=1000000;\
#    maxdepth=20;\
#    java.lang.String;\
#    java.lang.Number;\

#
# RMI Distributed Garbage Collector (DGC) Serial Filter
#
# The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter.
# This filter can override the builtin filter if additional types need to be
# allowed or rejected from the RMI DGC.
#
# Note: This property is currently used by the JDK Reference implementation.
# It is not guaranteed to be examined and used by other implementations.
#
# The builtin DGC filter can approximately be represented as the filter pattern:
#
#sun.rmi.transport.dgcFilter=\
#    java.rmi.server.ObjID;\
#    java.rmi.server.UID;\
#    java.rmi.dgc.VMID;\

# JCEKS Encrypted Key Serial Filter
#
# This filter, if configured, is used by the JCEKS KeyStore during the
# deserialization of the encrypted Key object stored inside a key entry.
# If not configured or the filter result is UNDECIDED (i.e. none of the patterns
# matches), the filter configured by jdk.serialFilter will be consulted.
#
# If the system property jceks.key.serialFilter is also specified, it supersedes
# the security property value defined here.
#
# The filter pattern uses the same format as jdk.serialFilter. The default
# pattern allows java.lang.Enum, java.security.KeyRep, java.security.KeyRep$Type,
# and javax.crypto.spec.SecretKeySpec and rejects all the others.
jceks.key.serialFilter = java.base/java.lang.Enum;java.base/java.security.KeyRep;\

#jdk.jceks.iterationCount = 200000

#
# PKCS12 KeyStore properties
#
# The following properties, if configured, are used by the PKCS12 KeyStore
# implementation during the creation of a new keystore. Several of the
# properties may also be used when modifying an existing keystore. The
# properties can be overridden by a KeyStore API that specifies its own
# algorithms and parameters.
#
# If an existing PKCS12 keystore is loaded and then stored, the algorithm and
# parameter used to generate the existing Mac will be reused. If the existing
# keystore does not have a Mac, no Mac will be created while storing. If there
# is at least one certificate in the existing keystore, the algorithm and
# parameters used to encrypt the last certificate in the existing keystore will
# be reused to encrypt all certificates while storing. If the last certificate
# in the existing keystore is not encrypted, all certificates will be stored

#
# In order to apply new algorithms and parameters to all entries in an
# existing keystore, one can create a new keystore and add entries in the
# existing keystore into the new keystore. This can be achieved by calling the
# "keytool -importkeystore" command.
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the

#
# If the property is set to an illegal value, an iteration count that is not

# when the property is used. If the property is not set or empty, a default
# value will be used.
#
# Some PKCS12 tools and libraries may not support algorithms based on PBES2
# and AES. To create a PKCS12 keystore which they can load, set the system
# property "keystore.pkcs12.legacy" which overrides the values of the properties
# defined below with legacy algorithms. Setting this system property (which can
# only be enabled and has no value) is equivalent to
#
#   -Dkeystore.pkcs12.certProtectionAlgorithm=PBEWithSHA1AndRC2_40
#   -Dkeystore.pkcs12.keyProtectionAlgorithm=PBEWithSHA1AndDESede
#   -Dkeystore.pkcs12.macAlgorithm=HmacPBESHA1

#   -Dkeystore.pkcs12.keyPbeIterationCount=50000
#   -Dkeystore.pkcs12.macIterationCount=100000
#
# Also, you can downgrade an existing PKCS12 keystore created with stronger
# algorithms to legacy algorithms with
#
#    keytool -J-Dkeystore.pkcs12.legacy -importkeystore -srckeystore ks -destkeystore ks

#
# Enhanced exception message information
#
# Exception messages may include potentially sensitive information such as file
# names, host names, or port numbers. By default, socket related exceptions
# have this information restricted (meaning the sensitive details are removed).
# Exception messages relating to JAR files and exceptions containing user
# identity information are also restricted by default.
# This property can be used to relax this restriction or to place further
# restrictions on other categories, defined below. The property
# accepts one or more comma separated values, each of which represents a
# category of enhanced exception message information to enable. Values are
# case-insensitive. Leading and trailing whitespaces, surrounding each value,
# are ignored. Unknown values are ignored.
#
# NOTE: Use caution before setting this property. Setting this property
# exposes sensitive information in Exceptions, which could, for example,
# propagate to untrusted code or be emitted in stack traces that are
# inadvertently disclosed and made accessible over a public network.
#
# The categories are:
#
#  hostInfo - All networking related exceptions will contain enhanced
#             exception message information.
#
#  hostInfoExclSocket - The hostInfo category defined above, excluding
#             IOExceptions thrown by java.net.Socket and the NetworkChannel
#             types in the java.nio.channels package, will contain enhanced
#             exception message information
#
#  jar      - enables more detailed information in the IOExceptions thrown
#             by classes in the java.util.jar package
#
#  userInfo - enables more detailed information in exceptions which may contain
#             user identity information
#
# The property setting in this file can be overridden by a system property of
# the same name, with the same syntax and possible values.
#
# If the property is not set or set to an empty string, then this is the most
# restricted setting with all categories disabled. The following is the default
# (out of the box) setting, meaning these categories are not restricted.
#

#
# Disabled mechanisms for the Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL)
#
# Disabled mechanisms will not be negotiated by both SASL clients and servers.
# These mechanisms will be ignored if they are specified in the "mechanisms"

# "Sasl.createSaslServer".
#
# The value of this property is a comma-separated list of SASL mechanisms.

# Policies for the proxy_impersonator Kerberos ccache configuration entry
#
# The proxy_impersonator ccache configuration entry indicates that the ccache
# is a synthetic delegated credential for use with S4U2Proxy by an intermediate
# server. The ccache file should also contain the TGT of this server and
# an evidence ticket from the default principal of the ccache to this server.
#
# This security property determines how Java uses this configuration entry.
# There are 3 possible values:
#
#  no-impersonate     - Ignore this configuration entry, and always act as
#                       the owner of the TGT (if it exists).
#
#  try-impersonate    - Try impersonation when this configuration entry exists.
#                       If no matching TGT or evidence ticket is found,
#                       fallback to no-impersonate.
#
#  always-impersonate - Always impersonate when this configuration entry exists.
#                       If no matching TGT or evidence ticket is found,
#                       no initial credential is read from the ccache.

# Trust Anchor Certificates - CA Basic Constraint check
#
# X.509 v3 certificates used as Trust Anchors (to validate signed code or TLS

# Global JNDI Object Factories Filter
#
# This filter is used by the JNDI runtime to control the set of object factory classes

# Policy for non-forwardable service ticket in a S4U2proxy request
#
# The Service for User to Proxy (S4U2proxy) Kerberos extension enables a middle service
# to obtain a service ticket to another service on behalf of a user. It requires that
# the user's service ticket to the first service has the forwardable flag set [1].
# However, some KDC implementations ignore this requirement and accept service tickets
# with the flag unset.
#
# If this security property is set to "true", then
#
# 1) The user service ticket, when obtained by the middle service after a S4U2self
#    impersonation, is not required to have the forwardable flag set; and,
#
# 2) If a S4U2proxy request receives a KRB_ERROR of the KDC_ERR_BADOPTION error code
#    and the ticket to the middle service is not forwardable, OpenJDK will try the same
#    request with another KDC instead of treating it as a fatal failure.
#
# The default value is "false".
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the

#
# Policy for name comparison in keytab and ccache entry lookup
#
# When looking up a keytab or credentials cache (ccache) entry for a Kerberos
# principal, the principal name is compared with the name in the entry.
# The comparison is by default case-insensitive. However, many Kerberos
# implementations consider principal names to be case-sensitive. Consequently,
# if two principals have names that differ only in case, there is a risk that
# an incorrect keytab or ccache entry might be selected.
#
# If this security property is set to "true", the comparison of principal
# names at keytab and ccache entry lookup is case-sensitive.
#
# The default value is "false".
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the

#
# X.509 AuthorityInfoAccess caIssuer URI Filtering
#
# This property defines a whitespace-separated list of filters that
# are applied to URIs found in the authorityInfoAccess extension in
# X.509 certificates. Any caIssuers URIs in X.509 certificates are only
# followed when the com.sun.security.enableAIAcaIssuers System property is
# enabled and the filter allows the URI. By default this property imposes a
# deny-all ruleset.  This property may be overridden by a System property
# of the same name.
#
# The filters must take the form of absolute, hierarchical URIs as defined by
# the java.net.URI class. Additionally, only the following protocols are
# allowed as filters: http, https, ldap and ftp.
# See RFC 5280, section 4.2.2.1 for details about the types of URIs allowed for
# the extension and their specific requirements.
# The filter matching rules are applied to each CA issuer URI as follows:
# 1. The scheme must match (case-insensitive).
# 2. A hostname or address must be specified in the filter URI.  It must match
#    the host or address in the caIssuers URI (case-insensitive).  No name
#    resolution is performed on hostnames to match IP addresses.
# 3. The port number must match.  For filter and caIssuer URIs, when a port
#    number is omitted, the well-known port for that scheme will be used in the
#    comparison.
# 4. For hierarchical filesystem schemes (e.g. http[s], ftp):
#    a. The normalized path portion of the filter URI is matched in a
#       case-sensitive manner.  If the final component of the path does not end
#       in a slash (/), it is considered to be a file path component and must
#       be an exact match of the caIssuer's URI file path component.  If the
#       final filter component ends in a slash, then it must either match or be
#       a prefix of the caIssuer's URI path component (e.g. a filter path of
#       /ab/cd/ will match a caIssuer path of /ab/cd/, /ab/cd/ef and
#       /ab/cd/ef/ghi).
#    b. Query strings will be ignored in filter rules and caIssuer URIs.
#    c. Fragments will be ignored in filter rules and caIssuer URIs.
# 5. For ldap URIs:
#    a. The base DN must be an exact match (case-insensitive).
#    b. Any query string in the rule, if specified, is ignored.
# 6. A single value "any" (case-insensitive) will create an allow-all rule.
#
# As an example, here is a valid filter policy consisting of two rules:
#    com.sun.security.allowedAIALocations=http://some.company.com/cacert \
#          ldap://ldap.company.com/dc=company,dc=com?caCertificate;binary
com.sun.security.allowedAIALocations=

#
# PKCS #8 encoding format for newly created ML-KEM and ML-DSA private keys
#
# draft-ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates-11 and RFC 9881 define three possible formats for a private key:
# a seed (64 bytes for ML-KEM, 32 bytes for ML-DSA), an expanded private key,
# or a sequence containing both.
#
# The following security properties determine the encoding format used when a
# new keypair is generated with a KeyPairGenerator, and the output of the
# translateKey method on an existing key using a ML-KEM or ML-DSA KeyFactory.
#
# Valid values for these properties are "seed", "expandedKey", and "both"
# (case-insensitive). The default is "seed".
#
# If a system property of the same name is also specified, it supersedes the
# security property value defined here.
#
# Note: These properties are currently used by the SunJCE (for ML-KEM) and SUN
# (for ML-DSA) providers in the JDK Reference implementation. They are not
# guaranteed to be supported by other implementations or third-party security
# providers.
