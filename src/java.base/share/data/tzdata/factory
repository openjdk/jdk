# tzdb data for noncommittal factory settings

# This file is in the public domain, so clarified as of
# 2009-05-17 by Arthur David Olson.

# For distributors who don't want to specify a timezone in their
# installation procedures.  Users who run 'date' will get the
# time zone abbreviation "-00", indicating that the actual time zone
# is unknown.

# TZ="Factory" was added to TZDB in 1989, and in 2016 its abbreviation
# was changed to "-00" from a longish English-language error message.
# Around 2010, CLDR added "Etc/Unknown" for use with TZDB, to stand
# for an unknown or invalid time zone.  These two notions differ:
# TZ="Factory" is a valid timezone, so tzalloc("Factory") succeeds, whereas
# TZ="Etc/Unknown" is invalid and tzalloc("Etc/Unknown") fails.
# Also, a downstream distributor could modify Factory to be a
# default timezone suitable for the devices it manufactures,
# whereas that cannot happen for Etc/Unknown.

# Zone	NAME	STDOFF	RULES	FORMAT
Zone	Factory	0	-	-00
