<h1>Debugging transported core dumps</h1>

<p>
When a core dump is moved to a machine different from the one where it was
produced ("transported core dump"), debuggers (dbx, gdb, windbg or SA) do not
always successfully open the core dump. This is due to library (shared
objects or DLLs) mismatches between the core dump machine and the debugger machine.
For this reason you should first consider using one of the following approaches to
debugging the core dump rather than transporting it to a different machine:
<ul>
  <li>Remote login to the machine that the core dump was produced on,
    and use <a href="clhsdb.html">CLHSDB - SA command line HSDB interface</a>.
  <li>Use SA remote debugging support to remotely debug the core directly on the machine
    it was produced on. This is done by first running <b>jhsdb debugd</b> on the machine with
    the core dump, and then attaching to it from another machine by using the jhsdb
    <b>--connect</b> argument. See the <b>jhsdb</b> man page for details.
</ul>
</p>

<p>
With transported core dumps, SA may produce an error message or throw
an exception (such as for a missing hotspot symbol) when opening the core dump.
Environment variable <b>LIBSAPROC_DEBUG</b> may be set to any value
to help debug the root casue of these failures. With <b>LIBSAPROC_DEBUG</b> set, SA prints many
messages in standard error which can be useful for further debugging. Note that
<b>LIBSAPROC_DEBUG</b> is not supported on Windows.
</p>

<p>
On most platforms, core dumps do not contain text (code) pages.
Their pages are instead read from the executable and shared objects (or DLLs).
Therefore it is important to have a matching java executable and shared object
files on the debugger machine. The best way to guarantee this match is to match the
debugger machine to that of core dump machine. This means having the same
OS version and libraries, and also having the same version of the JDK. It also means having
the OS libraries and JDK installed in the same locations on both machines. However, often
this isn't an option, and instead you need to copy the libraries and java installation from
the machine where the core dump was produced to the debugger machine, and you need
to tell SA where these are all located. That is done differently for each
OS type, and is described in the following sections.
</p>

<h3>Using transported core dumps on Linux</h3>
<p>
On Linux, SA parses core and shared library ELF files. But, you
may still face problems with transported core dumps, because matching shared
objects may not be in the path(s) specified in core dump file. To
workaround this, you can define environment variable <b>SA_ALTROOT</b>
to be the directory where shared libraries are kept. In this directory you should
copy all the needed JDK libraries, and any other user JNI libraries that were used.
You should also copy any referenced linux
libraries from the core dump machine, unless they are identical to what are
installed on the debugger machine.
</p>
<p>
 You can also use <b>SA_ALTROOT</b> to specify a path mapping. For example, if you
 set <b>SA_ALTROOT=/altroot</b>, then <b>/altroot</b> will be prepended to any path found
 in the core file, and also prepended to any subdir with the root part stripped off. For example,
 when looking up <b>/usr/lib/libfoo.so</b>, SA will try to find <b>/altroot/usr/lib/libfoo.so</b>,
 <b>/altroot/lib/libfoo.so</b>, and <b>/altroot/libfoo.so</b>.
</p>

<h3>Using transported core dumps on Windows</h3>
<p>
 If the debugger machine and core dump machine have identical Windows libraries, then you only
 need to point SA to the location of the JDK <b>java.exe</b> and libraries. This is done by making
 sure the <b>bin</b> and <b>bin/server</b> directories are included in the <b>PATH</b>
 environment variable. Something like the following should work if <b>JAVA_HOME</b>
 is setup:
 </p>

<code>
 set PATH=%JAVA_HOME%\bin;%JAVA_HOME%\bin\server;%PATH%
</code>

<p>
You can also include user JNI libraries in <b>PATH</b>.
If the windows libraries are not identical, then they may also need to be copied
to the debugger machine and included in <b>PATH</b>.
</p>

<p>
By default symbols are also located using <b>PATH</b>. However, there are also Java properties that
can be used to specify both the location of the binaries, and also separately the location of
symbols. Use <b>sun.jvm.hotspot.debugger.windbg.imagePath</b> for the location of binaries, and use
<b>sun.jvm.hotspot.debugger.windbg.symbolPath</b> for the location of symbols. <b>imagePath</b>
defaults to <b>PATH</b> if not set, and <b>symbolPath</b> defaults to <b>imagePath</b>. The
advantage of using these propeties is that you don't need to change your <b>PATH</b> setting, and
they allow for binaries to be located separately from symbols.
</p>

<p>
How you set these properties will depend on the SA tool being used. The following example
demonstrates how to set one of the properties when launching the clhsdb tool:
</p>

<code>
jhsdb -J-Dsun.jvm.hotspot.debugger.windbg.imagePath="%PATH%;D:\SomePath" clhsdb
</code>

<p>If you are not seeing symbols for Windows libraries, try setting
<b>sun.jvm.hotspot.debugger.windbg.symbolPath</b> to include
"<b>srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols</b>". Also include <b>PATH</b> so SA will still
find your JVM and JNI symbols. For example:
</p>

<code>
jhsdb -J-Dsun.jvm.hotspot.debugger.windbg.symbolPath="%PATH%;srv*https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbol" clhsdb
</code>

<h3>Using transported core dumps on macOS</h3>
<p>
 SA normally uses the path to the specified java executable to locate the JDK libraries. It will look
 in the following subdirectories for them (relative to the path to the specified java executable):
 <b>../lib</b>, <b>../lib/server</b>, <b>../jre/lib</b>, and <b>../jre/lib/server</b>. If not found
 in any of those locations, it will look in the same subdirectories relative to the <b>JAVA_HOME</b>
 environment variable, but using <b>JAVA_HOME</b> normally should not be necessary.
</p>

<p>
 For locating the user JNI libraries, SA uses <b>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</b>. It can contain
 more than one directory separated by a colon. <b>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</b> can also be
 used for locating the JDK libraries, but it needs to specify the full path to the libraries. SA
 will not automatically search subdirs such as <b>lib/server</b> as it does for <b>JAVA_HOME</b>.
</p>

<p>
 For locating the macOS libraries, SA uses <b>SA_ALTROOT</b> similar to the linux support,
 except it does not use it to map all the subdirs. It just prepends <b>SA_ALTROOT</b> to the
 full path of each macOS library. So if you specify <b>SA_ALTROOT=/altroot</b>, SA will
 prepend <b>/altroot</b> to the full path of each macOS library. Note however, due to
 <a href="https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8249779">JDK-8249779</a> , SA will not
 even try to open macOS libraries, so at the moment there is no need to try to match up the
 macOS libraries by pointing to them with <b>SA_ALTROOT</b>.
</p>

<p>
 Note: Starting with macOS 12, core files are no longer working with macOS on the x64 platform.
