    /**
     * The Dispatcher is responsible for accepting any connections and then using those connections
     * to processing any incoming requests. A connection is represented as an instance of
     * sun.net.httpserver.HttpConnection.
     *
     * Connection states:
     *  An instance of HttpConnection goes through the following states:
     *
     *  - NEWLY_ACCEPTED: A connection is marked as newly accepted as soon as the Dispatcher
     *    accept()s a connection. A newly accepted connection is added to a newlyAcceptedConnections
     *    collection. A newly accepted connection also gets added to the allConnections collection.
     *    The newlyAcceptedConnections isn't checked for any size limits, however, if the server is
     *    configured with a maximum connection limit, then the elements in the
     *    newlyAcceptedConnections will never exceed that configured limit (no explicit size checks
     *    are done on the newlyAcceptedConnections collection, since the maximum connection limit
     *    applies to connections across different connection states). A connection in NEWLY_ACCEPTED
     *    state is considered idle and is eligible for idle connection management.
     *
     *  - REQUEST: A connection is marked to be in REQUEST state when the request processing starts
     *    on that connection. This typically happens when the first byte of data is received on a
     *    NEWLY_ACCEPTED connection or when new data arrives on a connection which was previously
     *    in IDLE state. When a connection is in REQUEST state, it implies that the connection is
     *    active and thus isn't eligible for idle connection management. If the server is configured
     *    with a maximum request timeout, then connections in REQUEST state are eligible
     *    for Request/Response timeout management.
     *
     *  - RESPONSE: A connection is marked to be in RESPONSE state when the server has finished
     *    reading the request. A connection is RESPONSE state is considered active and isn't eligible
     *    for idle connection management. If the server is configured with a maximum response timeout,
     *    then connections in RESPONSE state are eligible for Request/Response timeout management.
     *
     *  - IDLE: A connection is marked as IDLE when a request/response cycle (successfully) completes
     *    on that particular connection. Idle connections are held in a idleConnections collection.
     *    The idleConnections collection is limited in size and the size is decided by a server
     *    configuration. Connections in IDLE state get added to the idleConnections collection only
     *    if that collection hasn't reached the configured limit. If a connection has reached IDLE
     *    state and there's no more room in the idleConnections collection, then such a connection
     *    gets closed. Connections in idleConnections collection are eligible for idle connection
     *    management.
     *
     * Idle connection management:
     *  A timer task is responsible for closing idle connections. Each connection that is in a state
     *  which is eligible for idle timeout management (see above section on connection states)
     *  will have a corresponding idle expiration time associated with it. The idle timeout management
     *  task will check the expiration time of each such connection against the current time and will
     *  close the connection if the current time is either equal to or past the expiration time.
     *
     * Request/Response timeout management:
     *  The server can be optionally configured with a maximum request timeout and/or maximum response
     *  timeout. If either of these timeouts have been configured, then an additional timer task is
     *  run by the server. This timer task is then responsible for closing connections which have
     *  been in REQUEST or RESPONSE state for a period of time that exceeds the respective configured
     *  timeouts.
     *
     * Maximum connection limit management:
     *  The server can be optionally configured with a maximum connection limit. A value of 0 or
     *  negative integer is ignored and considered to represent no connection limit. In case of a
     *  positive integer value, any newly accepted connections will be first checked against the
     *  current count of established connections (held by the allConnections collection) and if the
     *  configured limit has reached, then the newly accepted connection will be closed immediately
     *  (even before setting its state to NEWLY_ACCEPTED or adding it to the newlyAcceptedConnections
     *  collection).
