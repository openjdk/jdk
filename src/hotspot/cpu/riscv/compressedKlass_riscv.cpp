  // (two 32-bit sections, each split into two subsections of 20/12 bits).

  // A "good" base is, in this order:
  // 1) only bits in A; this would be an address < 4KB, which is unrealistic on normal Linux boxes since
  //    the typical default for vm.mmap_min_address is 64KB. We ignore that.
  // 2) only bits in B: a 12-bit-aligned address below 4GB. 12 bit = 4KB, but since mmap reserves at
  //    page boundaries, we can ignore the alignment.
  // 3) only bits in C: a 4GB-aligned address that is lower than 16TB.
  // 4) only bits in D: a 16TB-aligned address.

  // First, attempt to allocate < 4GB. We do this unconditionally:
  // - if can_optimize_for_zero_base, a <4GB mapping start would allow us to run unscaled (base = 0, shift = 0)

  //   with one instruction (2)
