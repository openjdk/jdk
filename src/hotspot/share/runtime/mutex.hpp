// A Mutex/Monitor is a simple wrapper around a native lock plus condition
// variable that supports lock ownership tracking, lock ranking for deadlock
// detection and coordinates with the safepoint protocol.

// Locking is non-recursive: if you try to lock a mutex you already own then you
// will get an assertion failure in a debug build (which should suffice to expose
// usage bugs). If you call try_lock on a mutex you already own it will return false.
// The underlying PlatformMutex may support recursive locking but this is not exposed
// and we account for that possibility in try_lock.

// A thread is not allowed to safepoint while holding a mutex whose rank
// is nosafepoint or lower.
