 * Evaluation order is guaranteed to be left-to-right. That is needed, for instance, to check
 * that a node has enough inputs before using `AtInput`, since `AtInput` won't fail gracefully
 * if the number of input is too low. E.g. if you know a node has 3 inputs and want patterns
 * to be applied to each input, it would look like
 * And::make(
 *    new HasExactlyNInputs(3),
 *    new AtInput(0, P0),
 *    new AtInput(1, P1),
 *    new AtInput(2, P2),

 * If we relied on `AtInput` to report too few inputs, it would give confusing error messages as
 * the first `AtInput` can only know it expects at least one input, and seeing the message
 * "Found 0 inputs, expected at least 1" is not very helpful, potentially confusing since it doesn't
 * state what is actually expected: 3 inputs.
 * It also is not able to express that a node has exactly a given number of inputs, and it is a
 * significant difference whether we expect AT LEAST 3 inputs, or EXACTLY 3 inputs. Let's make
 * things precise.
 * Overall, to get better reporting, `AtInput` is not expected to check the input count, and the
 * user is responsible for it, making the guarantee on the evaluation order of `And` necessary.
 *
 * The evaluation order can also allow you to check easier properties before harder ones: it's
 * nicer if you get a simpler error message, with shorter paths. It's also easier to read as C++
 * expressions when indentation is not going back and forth.
