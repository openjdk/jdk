/*
 * There are different kinds of predicates throughout the code. We differentiate between the following predicates:
 *
 * - Regular Predicate: This term is used to refer to a Runtime Predicate or an Assertion Predicate and can be used to
 *                      distinguish from any Parse Predicate which is not a real predicate but rather a placeholder.
 * - Parse Predicate: Added during parsing to capture the current JVM state. This predicate represents a "placeholder"
 *                    above which Regular Predicates can be created later after parsing.
 *
 *                    There are initially three Parse Predicates for each loop:
 *                    - Loop Parse Predicate:             The Parse Predicate added for Loop Predicates.
 *                    - Profiled Loop Parse Predicate:    The Parse Predicate added for Profiled Loop Predicates.
 *                    - Loop Limit Check Parse Predicate: The Parse Predicate added for a Loop Limit Check Predicate.
 * - Runtime Predicate: This term is used to refer to a Hoisted Check Predicate (either a Loop Predicate or a Profiled
 *                      Loop Predicate) or a Loop Limit Check Predicate. These predicates will be checked at runtime while
 *                      the Parse and Assertion Predicates are always removed before code generation (except for
 *                      Initialized Assertion Predicates which are kept in debug builds while being removed in product
 *                      builds).
 *     - Hoisted Check Predicate: Either a Loop Predicate or a Profiled Loop Predicate that is created during Loop
 *                                Predication to hoist a check out of a loop.
 *         - Loop Predicate:     This predicate is created to hoist a loop-invariant check or a range check of the
 *                               form "a[i*scale + offset]", where scale and offset are loop-invariant, out of a
 *                               counted loop. The hoisted check must be executed in each loop iteration. This predicate
 *                               is created during Loop Predication and is inserted above the Loop Parse Predicate. Each
 *                               predicate for a range check is accompanied by additional Assertion Predicates (see below).
 *         - Profiled Loop:      This predicate is very similar to a Loop Predicate but the check to be hoisted does not
 *           Predicate           need to be executed in each loop iteration. By using profiling information, only checks
 *                               with a high execution frequency are chosen to be replaced by a Profiled Loop Predicate.
 *                               This predicate is created during Loop Predication and is inserted above the Profiled
 *                               Loop Parse Predicate.
 *     - Loop Limit Check:   This predicate is created when transforming a loop to a counted loop to protect against
 *       Predicate           the case when adding the stride to the induction variable would cause an overflow which
 *                           will not satisfy the loop limit exit condition. This overflow is unexpected for further
 *                           counted loop optimizations and could lead to wrong results. Therefore, when this predicate
 *                           fails at runtime, we must trap and recompile the method without turning the loop into a
 *                           counted loop to avoid these overflow problems.
 *                           The predicate does not replace an actual check inside the loop. This predicate can only
 *                           be added once above the Loop Limit Check Parse Predicate for a loop.
 * - Assertion Predicate: An always true predicate which will never fail (its range is already covered by an earlier
 *                        Hoisted Check Predicate or the main-loop entry guard) but is required in order to fold away a
 *                        dead sub loop in which some data could be proven to be dead (by the type system) and replaced
 *                        by top. Without such Assertion Predicates, we could find that type ranges in Cast and ConvX2Y
 *                        data nodes become impossible and are replaced by top. This is an indicator that the sub loop
 *                        is never executed and must be dead. But there is no way for C2 to prove that the sub loop is
 *                        actually dead. Assertion Predicates come to the rescue to fold such seemingly dead sub loops
 *                        away to avoid a broken graph. Assertion Predicates are left in the graph as a sanity checks in
 *                        debug builds (they must never fail at runtime) while they are being removed in product builds.
 *                        We use special Opaque4 nodes to block some optimizations and replace the Assertion Predicates
 *                        later in product builds.
 *
 *                        There are two kinds of Assertion Predicates:
 *                        - Template Assertion Predicate:    A template for an Assertion Predicate that uses OpaqueLoop*
 *                                                           nodes as placeholders for the init and stride value of a loop.
 *                                                           This predicate does not represent an actual check, yet, and
 *                                                           just serves as a template to create an Initialized Assertion
 *                                                           Predicate for a (sub) loop.
 *                        - Initialized Assertion Predicate: An Assertion Predicate that represents an actual check for a
 *                                                           (sub) loop that was initialized by cloning a Template
 *                                                           Assertion Predicate. The check is always true and is covered
 *                                                           by an earlier check (a Hoisted Check Predicate or the
 *                                                           main-loop entry guard).
 *
 *                        Assertion Predicates are required when removing a range check from a loop. These are inserted
 *                        either at Loop Predication or at Range Check Elimination:
 *                        - Loop Predication:        A range check inside a loop is replaced by a Hoisted Check Predicate
 *                                                   before the loop. We add two additional Template Assertion Predicates
 *                                                   from which we can later create Initialized Assertion Predicates. One
 *                                                   would have been enough if the number of array accesses inside a sub
 *                                                   loop does not change. But when unrolling the sub loop, we are
 *                                                   doubling the number of array accesses - we need to cover them all.
 *                                                   To do that, we only need to create an Initialized Assertion Predicate
 *                                                   for the first, initial value and for the last value:
 *                                                   Let a[i] be an array access in the original, not-yet unrolled loop
 *                                                   with stride 1. When unrolling this loop, we double the stride
 *                                                   (i.e. stride 2) and have now two accesses a[i] and a[i+1]. We need
 *                                                   checks for both. When further unrolling this loop, we only need to
 *                                                   keep the checks on the first and last access (e.g. a[i] and a[i+3]
 *                                                   on the next unrolling step as they cover the checks in the middle
 *                                                   for a[i+1] and a[i+2]).
 *                                                   Therefore, we just need to cover:
 *                                                   - Initial value: a[init]
 *                                                   - Last value: a[init + new stride - original stride]
 *                                                   (We could still only use one Template Assertion Predicate to create
 *                                                   both Initialized Assertion Predicates from - might be worth doing
 *                                                   at some point).
 *                                                   When later splitting a loop (pre/main/post, peeling, unrolling),
 *                                                   we create two Initialized Assertion Predicates from the Template
 *                                                   Assertion Predicates by replacing the OpaqueLoop* nodes by actual
 *                                                   values. Initially (before unrolling), both Assertion Predicates are
 *                                                   equal. The Initialized Assertion Predicates are always true because
 *                                                   their range is covered by a corresponding Hoisted Check Predicate.
 *                        - Range Check Elimination: A range check is removed from the main-loop by changing the pre
 *                                                   and main-loop iterations. We add two additional Template Assertion
 *                                                   Predicates (see explanation in section above) and one Initialized
 *                                                   Assertion Predicate for the just removed range check. When later
 *                                                   unrolling the main-loop, we create two Initialized Assertion
 *                                                   Predicates from the Template Assertion Predicates by replacing the
 *                                                   OpaqueLoop* nodes by actual values for the unrolled loop.
 *                                                   The Initialized Assertion Predicates are always true: They are true
 *                                                   when entering the main-loop (because we adjusted the pre-loop exit
 *                                                   condition), when executing the last iteration of the main-loop
 *                                                   (because we adjusted the main-loop exit condition), and during all
 *                                                   other iterations of the main-loop in-between by implication.
 *                                                   Note that Range Check Elimination could remove additional range
 *                                                   checks which were not possible to remove with Loop Predication
 *                                                   before (for example, because no Parse Predicates were available
 *                                                   before the loop to create Hoisted Check Predicates with).
 *
 *
 * In order to group predicates and refer to them throughout the code, we introduce the following additional term:
 * - Predicate Block: A block containing all Runtime Predicates, including the Assertion Predicates for Range Check
 *                    Predicates, and the associated Parse Predicate which all share the same uncommon trap. This block
 *                    could be empty if there were no Runtime Predicates created and the Parse Predicate was already
 *                    removed.
 *                    There are three different Predicate Blocks:
 *                    - Loop Predicate Block: Groups the Loop Predicates (if any), including the Assertion Predicates,
 *                                            and the Loop Parse Predicate (if not removed, yet) together.
 *                    - Profiled Loop         Groups the Profiled Loop Predicates (if any), including the Assertion
 *                      Predicate Block:      Predicates, and the Profiled Loop Parse Predicate (if not removed, yet)
 *                                            together.
 *                    - Loop Limit Check      Groups the Loop Limit Check Predicate (if created) and the Loop Limit
 *                      Predicate Block:      Check Parse Predicate (if not removed, yet) together.
 *
 *
 * Initially, before applying any loop-splitting optimizations, we find the following structure after Loop Predication
 * (predicates inside square brackets [] do not need to exist if there are no checks to hoist):
 *
 *   [Loop Predicate 1 + two Template Assertion Predicates]            \
 *   [Loop Predicate 2 + two Template Assertion Predicates]            |
 *   ...                                                               | Loop Predicate Block
 *   [Loop Predicate n + two Template Assertion Predicates]            |
 * Loop Parse Predicate                                                /
 *
 *   [Profiled Loop Predicate 1 + two Template Assertion Predicates]   \
 *   [Profiled Loop Predicate 2 + two Template Assertion Predicates]   | Profiled Loop
 *   ...                                                               | Predicate Block
 *   [Profiled Loop Predicate m + two Template Assertion Predicates]   |
 * Profiled Loop Parse Predicate                                       /
 *
 *   [Loop Limit Check Predicate] (at most one)                        \ Loop Limit Check
 * Loop Limit Check Parse Predicate                                    / Predicate Block
 * Loop Head
 *
 * As an example, let's look at how the predicate structure looks for the main-loop after creating pre/main/post loops
 * and applying Range Check Elimination (the order is insignificant):
 *
 * Main Loop entry (zero-trip) guard
 *   [For Loop Predicate 1: Two Template + two Initialized Assertion Predicates]
 *   [For Loop Predicate 2: Two Template + two Initialized Assertion Predicates]
 *   ...
 *   [For Loop Predicate n: Two Template + two Initialized Assertion Predicates]
 *
 *   [For Profiled Loop Predicate 1: Two Template + two Initialized Assertion Predicates]
 *   [For Profiled Loop Predicate 2: Two Template + two Initialized Assertion Predicates]
 *   ...
 *   [For Profiled Loop Predicate m: Two Template + two Initialized Assertion Predicates]
 *
 *   (after unrolling, we have two Initialized Assertion Predicates for the Assertion Predicates of Range Check Elimination)
 *   [For Range Check Elimination Check 1: Two Templates + one Initialized Assertion Predicate]
 *   [For Range Check Elimination Check 2: Two Templates + one Initialized Assertion Predicate]
 *   ...
 *   [For Range Check Elimination Check k: Two Templates + one Initialized Assertion Predicate]
 * Main Loop Head
