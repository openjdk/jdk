// The streaming archive heap loader loads Java objects using normal allocations. It requires the objects
// to be ordered in DFS order already at dump time, given the set of roots into the archived heap.
// Since the objects are ordered in DFS order, that means that walking them linearly through the archive
// is equivalent to performing a DFS traversal, but without pushing and popping anything.
//
// The advantage of this pre-ordering, other than the obvious locality improvement, is that we can have
// a separate thread, the AOTThread, perform this walk, in a way that allows us to split the archived
// heap into three separate zones. The first zone contains objects that have been transitively materialized,
// the second zone contains objects that are currently being materialized, and the last zone contains
// objects that have not and are not about to be touched by the AOT thread.
// Whenever a new root is traversed by the AOT thread, the zones are shifted atomically under a lock.
//
// Visualization of the three zones:
//
// +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------+
// |      transitively materialized       | currently materializing |        not yet materialized      |
// +--------------------------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------+
//
// Being able to split the memory into these three zones, allows the bootstrapping thread and potential
// other threads to be able to, under a lock, traverse a root, and know how to coordinate with the
// concurrent AOT thread. Whenever the traversal finds an object in the "transitively materialized"
// zone, then we know such objects don't need any processing at all. As for "currently materializing",
// we know that if we just stay out of the way and let the AOT thread finish its current root, then
// the transitive closure of such objects will be materialized. And the AOT thread can materialize faster
// then the rest as it doesn't need to perform any traversal. Finally, as for objects in the "not yet
// materialized" zone, we know that we can trace through it without stepping on the feed of the AOT thread
// which has published it won't be tracing anything in there.
//
// What we get from this, is fast iterative traversal from the AOT thread (IterativeObjectLoader)
// while allowing lazyness and concurrency with the rest of the program (TracingObjectLoader).
// This way the AOT thread can remove the bulk of the work of materializing the Java objects from
// the critical bootstrapping thread.
//
// When we start materializing objects, we have not yet come to the point in the bootstrapping where
// GC is allowed. This is a two edged sword. On the one hand side, we can materialize objects faster
// when we know there is no GC to coordinate with, but on the other hand side, if we need to perform
// a GC when allocating memory for archived objects, we will bring down the entire JVM. To deal with this,
// the AOT thread asks the GC for a budget of bytes it is allowed to allocate before GC is allowed.
// When we get to the point in the bootstrapping where GC is allowed, we resume materializing objects
// that didn't fit in the budget. Before we let the application run, we force materialization of any
// remaining objects that have not been materialized by the AOT thread yet, so that we don't get
// surprising OOMs due to object materialization while the program is running.
//
// The object format of the archived heap is similar to a normal object. However, references are encoded
// as DFS indices, which in the end map to what index the object is in the buffer, as they are laid out
// in DFS order. The DFS indices start at 1 for the first object, and hence the number 0 represents
// null. The DFS index of objects is a core identifier of objects in this approach. From this index
// it is possible to find out what offset the archived object has into the buffer, as well as finding
// mappings to Java heap objects that have been materialized.
//
// The table mapping DFS indices to Java heap objects is filled in when an object is allocated.
// Materializing objects involves allocating the object, initializing it, and linking it with other
// objects. Since linking the object requires whatever is being referenced to be at least allocated,
// the iterative traversal will first allocate all of the objects in its zone being worked on, and then
// perform initialization and linking in a second pass. What these passes have in common is that they
// are trivially parallelizable, should we ever need to do that. The tracing materialization links
// objects when going "back" in the DFS traversal.
//
// The forwarding information for the mechanism contains raw oops before GC is allowed, and as we
// enable GC in the bootstrapping, all raw oops are handleified using OopStorage. All handles are
// handed back from the AOT thread when materialization has finished. The switch from raw oops to
// using OopStorage handles, happens under a lock while no iteration nor tracing is allowed.
//
// The initialization code is also performed in a faster way when the GC is not allowed. In particular,
// before GC is allowed, we perform raw memcpy of the archived object into the Java heap. Then the
// object is initialized with IS_DEST_UNINITIALIZED stores. The assumption made here is that before
// any GC activity is allowed, we shouldn't have to worry about concurrent GC threads scanning the
// memory and getting tripped up by that. Once GC is enabled, we revert to a bit more careful approach
// that uses a pre-computed bitmap to find the holes where oops go, and carefully copy only the
// non-oop information with memcpy, while the oops are set separately with HeapAccess stores that
// should be able to cope well with concurrent activity.
//
// The marked bit pattern of the mark word of archived heap objects is used for signalling which string
// objects should be interned. From the dump, some referenced strings were interned. This is
// really an identity property. We don't need to dump the entire string table as a way of communicating
// this identity property. Instead we intern strings on-the-fly, exploiting the dynamic object
// level linking that this approach has chosen to our advantage.
