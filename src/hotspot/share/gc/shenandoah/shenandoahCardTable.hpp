  //
  // Concurrent remembered set scanning reads from _read_byte_map while concurrent mutator write
  // barriers are overwriting cards of the _write_byte_map with DIRTY codes.  Concurrent remembered
  // set scanning also overwrites cards of the _write_byte_map with DIRTY codes whenever it discovers
  // interesting pointers.
  //
  // During a concurrent update-references phase, we scan the _write_byte_map concurrently to find
  // all old-gen references that may need to be updated.
  //
  // In a future implementation, we may swap the values of _read_byte_map and _write_byte_map during
  // the init-mark safepoint to avoid the need for bulk STW copying and initialization.  Doing so
  // requires a change to the implementation of mutator write barriers as the address of the card
  // table is currently in-lined and hard-coded.
