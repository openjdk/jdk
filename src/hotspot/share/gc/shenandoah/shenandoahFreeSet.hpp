//
// The Shenandoah garbage collector evacuates live objects out of specific regions that are identified as members of the
// collection set (cset).
//
// The ShenandoahFreeSet tries to colocate survivor objects (objects that have been evacuated at least once) at the
// high end of memory.  New mutator allocations are taken from the low end of memory.  Within the mutator's range of regions,
// humongous allocations are taken from the lowest addresses, and LAB (local allocation buffers) and regular shared allocations
// are taken from the higher address of the mutator's range of regions.  This approach allows longer lasting survivor regions
// to congregate at the top of the heap and longer lasting humongous regions to congregate at the bottom of the heap, with
// short-lived frequently evacuated regions occupying the middle of the heap.
//
// Mutator and garbage collection activities tend to scramble the content of regions.  Twice, during each GC pass, we rebuild
// the free set in an effort to restore the efficient segregation of Collector and Mutator regions:
//
//  1. At the start of evacuation, we know exactly how much memory is going to be evacuated, and this guides our
//     sizing of the Collector free set.
//
//  2. At the end of GC, we have reclaimed all of the memory that was spanned by the cset.  We rebuild here to make
//     sure there is enough memory reserved at the high end of memory to hold the objects that might need to be evacuated

   * Internal fragmentation metric: describes how fragmented the heap regions are.

   *
   *               sum(used[i]^2, i=0..k)
   *   IF = 1 - ------------------------------
   *              C * sum(used[i], i=0..k)

   * used[i] is the used space in the region.
   *
   * The non-linearity causes IF to be lower for the cases where the same total heap
   * used is densely packed. For example:
   *   a) Heap is completely full  => IF = 0
   *   b) Heap is half full, first 50% regions are completely full => IF = 0
   *   c) Heap is half full, each region is 50% full => IF = 1/2
   *   d) Heap is quarter full, first 50% regions are completely full => IF = 0
   *   e) Heap is quarter full, each region is 25% full => IF = 3/4
   *   f) Heap has one small object per each region => IF =~ 1
