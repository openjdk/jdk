//
// Contains heuristics to resize the heap, i.e. expand or shrink, during operation.
//
// For young collections, this heuristics is based on GC CPU usage, i.e. trying to
// change the heap so that the GC CPU usage stays approximately close to the target
// GC CPU usage set by the user.
//
// The heuristics track both short and long term GC behavior to affect heap resizing.
//
// Short term tracking is based on the short-term GC CPU usage i.e we count events
// for which short-term GC CPU usage is outside the range:
// gc_cpu_usage_target Ã— [1 - d, 1 + d], where d = G1CPUUsageDeviationPercent / 100
// If below that range, we decrement that counter, if above, we increment it.
//
// If that counter reaches the G1CPUUsageExpandThreshold we consider expansion,
// if that counter reaches -G1CPUUsageShrinkThreshold we consider shrinking the heap.
//
// While doing so, we accumulate the relative difference to the target GC CPU usage
// to guide the expansion/shrinking amount.
//
// Furthermore, if there is no short-term based resizing event for a "long" time,
// we decay that counter, i.e. drop it towards zero again to avoid that previous
// intermediate length short term behavior followed by a quiet time and a single
// short term event causes unnecessary resizes.
//
// Long term behavior is solely managed by regularly comparing actual long term
// GC CPU usage with the boundaries of acceptable deviation range. If the actual
// long term GC CPU usage is outside this range, expand or shrink accordingly.
//
// The mechanism is meant to filter out short term events because heap resizing
// has some overhead.
//
// For full collections, we base resize decisions only on Min/MaxHeapFreeRatio.
