  // empty.
  // This allows us to calculate the new PLAB size to achieve the
  // TargetPLABWastePct given the latest memory usage and that the last buffer
  // will be G1LastPLABAverageOccupancy full.
  //
  // E.g. assume that if in the current GC 100 words were allocated and a
  // TargetPLABWastePct of 10 had been set.
  //
  // So we could waste up to 10 words to meet that percentage. Given that we
  // also assume that that buffer is typically half-full (G1LastPLABAverageOccupancy),
  // the new desired PLAB size is set to 20 words.
  //
  // (This also implies that we expect (100-G1LastPLABAverageOccupancy)/TargetPLABWastePct
  // number of refills during allocation).
  //
  // The amount of allocation performed should be independent of the number of
  // threads, so should the maximum waste we can spend in total. So if
  // we used n threads to allocate, each of them can spend maximum waste/n words in
  // a first rough approximation. The number of threads only comes into play later
  // when actually retrieving the actual desired PLAB size.
  //
  // After calculating this optimal PLAB size the algorithm applies the usual
  // exponential decaying average over this value to guess the next PLAB size.
  //
  // We account region end waste fully to PLAB allocation (in the calculation of
  // what we consider as "used_for_waste_calculation" below). This is not
  // completely fair, but is a conservative assumption because PLABs may be sized
  // flexibly while we cannot adjust inline allocations.
  // Allocation during GC will try to minimize region end waste so this impact
  // should be minimal.
  //
  // We need to cover overflow when calculating the amount of space actually used
  // by objects in PLABs when subtracting the region end waste.
  // Region end waste may be higher than actual allocation. This may occur if many
  // threads do not allocate anything but a few rather large objects. In this
  // degenerate case the PLAB size would simply quickly tend to minimum PLAB size,
  // which is an okay reaction.
