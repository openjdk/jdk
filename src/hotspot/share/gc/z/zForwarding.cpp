//
// The relocated_remembered_fields are used when the old generation
// collection is relocating objects, concurrently with the young
// generation collection's remembered set scanning for the marking.
//
// When the OC is relocating objects, the old remembered set bits
// for the from-space objects need to be moved over to the to-space
// objects.
//
// The YC doesn't want to wait for the OC, so it eagerly helps relocating
// objects with remembered set bits, so that it can perform marking on the
// to-space copy of the object fields that are associated with the remembered
// set bits.
//
// This requires some synchronization between the OC and YC, and this is
// mainly done via the _relocated_remembered_fields_state in each ZForwarding.
// The values corresponds to:
//
// none:      Starting state - neither OC nor YC has stated their intentions
// published: The OC has completed relocating all objects, and published an array
//            of all to-space fields that should have a remembered set entry.
// reject:    The OC relocation of the page happened concurrently with the YC
//            remset scanning. Two situations:
//            a) The page had not been released yet: The YC eagerly relocated and
//            scanned the to-space objects with remset entries.
//            b) The page had been released: The YC accepts the array published in
//            (published).
// accept:    The YC found that the forwarding/page had already been relocated when
//            the YC started.
//
// Central to this logic is the ZRemembered::scan_forwarding function, where
// the YC tries to "retain" the forwarding/page. If it succeeds it means that
// the OC has not finished (or maybe not even started) the relocation of all objects.
//
// When the YC manages to retaining the page it will bring the state from:
//  none      -> reject - Started collecting remembered set info
//  published -> reject - Rejected the OC's remembered set info
//  reject    -> reject - An earlier YC had already handled the remembered set info
//  accept    ->        - Invalid state - will not happen
//
// When the YC fails to retain the page the state transitions are:
// none      -> x - The page was relocated before the YC started
// published -> x - The OC completed relocation before YC visited this forwarding.
//                  The YC will use the remembered set info collected by the OC.
// reject    -> x - A previous YC has already handled the remembered set info
// accept    -> x - See above
//
// x is:
//  reject        - if the relocation finished while the current YC was running
//  accept        - if the relocation finished before the current YC started
//
// Note the subtlety that even though the relocation could released the page
// and made it non-retainable, the relocation code might not have gotten to
// the point where the page is removed from the page table. It could also be
// the case that the relocated page became in-place relocated, and we therefore
// shouldn't be scanning it this YC.
//
// The (reject) state is the "dangerous" state, where both OC and YC work on
// the same forwarding/page somewhat concurrently. While (accept) denotes that
// that the entire relocation of a page (including freeing/reusing it) was
// completed before the current YC started.
//
// After all remset entries of relocated objects have been scanned, the code
// proceeds to visit all pages in the page table, to scan all pages not part
// of the OC relocation set. Pages with virtual addresses that doesn't match
// any of the once in the OC relocation set will be visited. Pages with
// virtual address that *do* have a corresponding forwarding entry has two
// cases:
//
// a) The forwarding entry is marked with (reject). This means that the
//    corresponding page is guaranteed to be one that has been relocated by the
//    current OC during the active YC. Any remset entry is guaranteed to have
//    already been scanned by the scan_forwarding code.
//
// b) The forwarding entry is marked with (accept). This means that the page was
//    *not* created by the OC relocation during this YC, which means that the
//    page must be scanned.
