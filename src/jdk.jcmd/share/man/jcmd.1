jcmd - send diagnostic command requests to a running Java Virtual

\f[V]jcmd\f[R] [\f[I]pid\f[R] | \f[I]main-class\f[R]]
\f[I]command\f[R]...
| \f[V]PerfCounter.print\f[R] | \f[V]-f\f[R] \f[I]filename\f[R]

.PP
\f[V]jcmd\f[R] \f[V]-h\f[R]
.TP
\f[I]pid\f[R]
When used, the \f[V]jcmd\f[R] utility sends the diagnostic command
request to the process ID for the Java process.
.TP
\f[I]main-class\f[R]
When used, the \f[V]jcmd\f[R] utility sends the diagnostic command
request to all Java processes with the specified name of the main class.
.TP
\f[I]command\f[R]
The \f[V]command\f[R] must be a valid \f[V]jcmd\f[R] command for the
selected JVM.
The list of available commands for \f[V]jcmd\f[R] is obtained by running
the \f[V]help\f[R] command (\f[V]jcmd\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R] \f[V]help\f[R])
where \f[I]pid\f[R] is the process ID for the running Java process.
If the \f[I]pid\f[R] is \f[V]0\f[R], commands will be sent to all Java
processes.
The main class argument will be used to match, either partially or
fully, the class used to start Java.
If no options are given, it lists the running Java process identifiers
with the main class and command-line arguments that were used to launch
the process (the same as using \f[V]-l\f[R]).
.TP
\f[V]Perfcounter.print\f[R]
Prints the performance counters exposed by the specified Java process.
.TP
\f[V]-f\f[R] \f[I]filename\f[R]
Reads and executes commands from a specified file, \f[I]filename\f[R].
.TP
\f[V]-l\f[R]
Displays the list of Java Virtual Machine process identifiers that are
not running in a separate docker process along with the main class and
command-line arguments that were used to launch the process.
If the JVM is in a docker process, you must use tools such as
\f[V]ps\f[R] to look up the PID.
.RS
.PP
\f[B]Note:\f[R]
.PP
Using \f[V]jcmd\f[R] without arguments is the same as using
\f[V]jcmd -l\f[R].
.RE
.TP
\f[V]-h\f[R]
Displays the \f[V]jcmd\f[R] utility\[aq]s command-line help.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[V]jcmd\f[R] utility is used to send diagnostic command requests
to the JVM.
It must be used on the same machine on which the JVM is running, and
have the same effective user and group identifiers that were used to
launch the JVM.
Each diagnostic command has its own set of arguments.
To display the description, syntax, and a list of available arguments
for a diagnostic command, use the name of the command as the argument.
For example:
.RS
.PP
\f[V]jcmd\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R] \f[V]help\f[R] \f[I]command\f[R]
.RE
.PP
If arguments contain spaces, then you must surround them with single or
double quotation marks (\f[V]\[aq]\f[R] or \f[V]\[dq]\f[R]).
In addition, you must escape single or double quotation marks with a
backslash (\f[V]\[rs]\f[R]) to prevent the operating system shell from
processing quotation marks.
Alternatively, you can surround these arguments with single quotation
marks and then with double quotation marks (or with double quotation
marks and then with single quotation marks).
.PP
If you specify the process identifier (\f[I]pid\f[R]) or the main class
(\f[I]main-class\f[R]) as the first argument, then the \f[V]jcmd\f[R]
utility sends the diagnostic command request to the Java process with
the specified identifier or to all Java processes with the specified
name of the main class.
You can also send the diagnostic command request to all available Java
processes by specifying \f[V]0\f[R] as the process identifier.
.SH COMMANDS FOR JCMD
.PP
The \f[I]command\f[R] must be a valid \f[V]jcmd\f[R] diagnostic command
for the selected JVM.
The list of available commands for \f[V]jcmd\f[R] is obtained by running
the \f[V]help\f[R] command (\f[V]jcmd\f[R] \f[I]pid\f[R] \f[V]help\f[R])
where \f[I]pid\f[R] is the process ID for a running Java process.
If the \f[I]pid\f[R] is \f[V]0\f[R], commands will be sent to all Java
processes.
The main class argument will be used to match, either partially or
fully, the class used to start Java.
If no options are given, it lists the running Java process identifiers
that are not in separate docker processes along with the main class and
command-line arguments that were used to launch the process (the same as
using \f[V]-l\f[R]).

The following profiles are included with the JDK in the
\f[V]JAVA-HOME\f[R]/lib/jfr directory: \[aq]default.jfc\[aq]: collects a
predefined set of information with low overhead, so it has minimal
impact on performance and can be used with recordings that run
continuously; \[aq]profile.jfc\[aq]: Provides more data than the
\[aq]default.jfc\[aq] profile, but with more overhead and impact on
performance.
Use this configuration for short periods of time when more information
is needed.
Use \f[V]none\f[R] to start a recording without a predefined
configuration file.
(STRING, \f[V]JAVA-HOME\f[R]/lib/jfr/default.jfc)
.PP
Event settings and .jfc options can be specified using the following
syntax:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]option\f[R]: (Optional) Specifies the option value to modify.
To list available options, use the \f[V]JAVA_HOME\f[R]/bin/jfr tool.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[V]event-setting\f[R]: (Optional) Specifies the event setting value to
modify.
Use the form: \f[V]<event-name>#<setting-name>=<value>\f[R] To add a new
event setting, prefix the event name with \[aq]+\[aq].
.PP
You can specify values for multiple event settings and .jfc options by
separating them with a whitespace.
In case of a conflict between a parameter and a .jfc option, the
parameter will take precedence.
The whitespace delimiter can be omitted for timespan values, i.e.
20ms.
For more information about the settings syntax, see Javadoc of the
jdk.jfr package.
