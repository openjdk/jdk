/**
 * A JAXB Bean that works like a DOM.
 *
 * <p>
 * This bean is bound to XML as a sequence of elements, where each
 * element[i] is from bridges[i] (which defines the tag name and the expected type)
 * and values[i] (which defines the actual value.)
 *
 * <p>
 * This object allows you to treat multiple unrelated JAXB beans as a single tree.
 * This in turn allows you to marshal this tree in one marshal method invocation,
 * which is faster than multiple invocations of the marshal method.
 *
 * <p>
 * The binding of this class is always known to {@link BindingContext}, so it can be
 * used without passing anything to {@link BindingContext#newWrapperInstace(Class)}.
 * This object can be only used for marshalling, not for unmarshalling.
