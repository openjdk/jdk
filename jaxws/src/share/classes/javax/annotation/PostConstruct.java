/**
 * The PostConstruct annotation is used on a method that needs to be executed
 * after dependency injection is done to perform any initialization. This
 * method MUST be invoked before the class is put into service. This
 * annotation MUST be supported on all classes that support dependency
 * injection. The method annotated with PostConstruct MUST be invoked even
 * if the class does not request any resources to be injected. Only one
 * method can be annotated with this annotation. The method on which the
 * PostConstruct annotation is applied MUST fulfill all of the following
 * criteria -
- The method MUST NOT have any parameters except in the case of EJB
 * interceptors   in which case it takes an InvocationC ontext object as
 * defined by the EJB   specification.
 * - The return type of the method MUST be void.
 * - The method MUST NOT throw a checked exception.
 * - The method on which PostConstruct is applied MAY be public, protected,
 * package private or private.
 * - The method MUST NOT be static except for the application client.
 * - The method MAY be final.
 * - If the method throws an unchecked exception the class MUST NOT be put into
 * service except in the case of EJBs where the EJB can handle exceptions and
 * even   recover from them.
