    An xmime:expectedContentTypes attribute is present on an incorrect element

BGMBuilder.MultipleSchemaBindings = \
        Multiple <schemaBindings> are defined for the target namespace "{0}"

BGMBuilder.MultipleSchemaBindings.Location = \
        Another <schemaBindings> is defined here



ClassSelector.ClassNameIsRequired = \
        Cannot derive a name from schema. A name attribute specified to the <class> customization.

ClassSelector.IncorrectClassName = \
        Specified name ''{0}'' is not a valid Java identifier.

ClassSelector.IncorrectPackageName = \
        The package name ''{1}'' used for this schema is not a valid package name.

ClassSelector.JavadocHeading = \
        <p>Java class for {0}.\n\n<p>The following schema fragment specifies the expected \
        content contained within this class.

ClassSelector.JavadocLineUnknown = \
        unknown

ClassSelector.ReservedClassName = \
        Attempt to create a class having the same name as the reserved word "{0}".


CollisionInfo.CollisionInfo = \
        The field name "{0}" is used by two different parts of a schema. See: \n\
        {1}\n\
        {2}

CollisionInfo.UnknownFile = \
        unknown file

CollisionInfo.LineXOfY = \
        line {0} of {1}


ConversionFinder.CannotBeTypeSafeEnum = \
        A type safe enum customization is specified to a simple type that cannot \
        be mapped to a type safe enum.
ConversionFinder.CannotBeTypeSafeEnum.Location = \
        Ths relevant simple type declaration is specified at this location
ConversionFinder.NoEnumNameAvailable = \
        A name attribute is required to customize an anonymous simple type to type-safe enum.
ConversionFinder.NoEnumFacet= \
    enum class customization is specified on a type that has no enumeration facet.
ERR_ILLEGAL_EXPECTED_MIME_TYPE = \
    Unable to parse the expected MIME type "{0}". {1}.


DatatypeBuilder.DatatypeError = \
        Simple type error: {0}






DefaultParticleBinder.UnableToGenerateNameFromModelGroup = \
        Unable to generate a property name from a model group. A customization is required.

DefaultParticleBinder.FallbackJavadoc = \
        Gets the rest of the content model. \n\
        \n\
        <p>\n\
        You are getting this "catch-all" property because of the following reason: \n\
        {0}\n\
        <p>\n\
        To get rid of this property, apply a property customization to one \n\
        of both of the following declarations to change their names: \n







FieldBuilder.IncorrectFixedValue = \
        The value specified in the fixed attribute "{0}" is not a valid value for the datatype

FieldBuilder.IncorrectDefaultValue = \
        The value specified in the default attribute "{0}" is not a valid value for the datatype

FieldBuilder.ConflictBetweenUserTypeAndActualType.AttUse = \
        "{0}" is specified by a customization but this attribute has incompatible type "{1}"

FieldBuilder.ConflictBetweenUserTypeAndActualType.AttUse.Source = \
        The relevant customization is specified at this location

FieldBuilder.Javadoc.NilProperty = \
        This property is used to control \
        <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2001/REC-xmlschema-0-20010502/#Nils">the xsi:nil feature</a> \
        of W3C XML Schema. \nSetting this property to true will cause \
        the output to be &lt;{0} xsi:nil="true" /> regardless of the \
        values of the other properties.

FieldBuilder.Javadoc.ValueObject = \
        get/set the complex type value associated with this element.\n \
        when you unmarshal a document that contains xsi:type, the get{1} method \
        would return an instance of derived classes of '{'@link {0}'}'. Similarly, if you set \
        an instance of derived classes, then you would get the instance with xsi:type \
        when you marshal out to XML.


SimpleTypeBuilder.UnnestedJavaTypeCustomization = \
    <javaType> customization in this context must be nested (JAXB spec sec 6.8.1): \n\

ERR_REFERENCE_TO_NONEXPORTED_CLASS = \
    {0} is in a referenced schema and do not have the corresponding Java class specified by \
    <jaxb:class ref="..."/> customization. Therefore it cannot be referenced from outside.
