# Included or excluded types must take one of two forms
# - *.class to indicate all classes; or else
# - a full single type name e.g.
#     javax/management/remote/rmi/_RMIServer_Stub.class
# You can not use arbitrary wildcards like _RMI*.class.
#
# Notes:
# - Nested types must use $$ in place of $ as $ is the make meta-character
# - If a package is not listed in any profile's inclusion list then it will
#   not appear in any profile. But if a package is also missing from the
#   full JRE's inclusion list then it will still be part of the full JRE.
#   This is because the full JRE's inclusion lists are only used to define
#   the exclusion lists for profiles; they are not used to define the full
#   JRE contents - that is still done with the pre-profile legacy mechanism
#   (all packagesthat can be found, less those not intended for rt.jar).
#   This was done to minimize the impact of profiles on the regular
#   non-profile build.
