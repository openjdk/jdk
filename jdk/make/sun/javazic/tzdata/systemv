# Old rules, should the need arise.
# No attempt is made to handle Newfoundland, since it cannot be expressed
# using the System V "TZ" scheme (half-hour offset), or anything outside
# North America (no support for non-standard DST start/end dates), nor
# the changes in the DST rules in the US after 1976 (which occurred after
# the old rules were written).
#
# If you need the old rules, uncomment ## lines.
# Compile this *without* leap second correction for true conformance.
