\f3jsadebugd\fP attaches to a Java process or core file and acts as a debug server. Remote clients such as jstack(1), jmap(1), and jinfo(1) can attach to the server using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI). Before starting \f2jsadebugd\fP, 
.na

where \f2$JAVA_HOME\fP is the JDK installation directory. If rmiregistry was not started, jsadebugd will start an rmiregistry in a standard (1099) port internally. Debug server may be stopped by sending SIGINT (pressing Ctrl\-C) to it.

\f3NOTE \- This utility is unsupported and may or may not be available in future versions of the JDK. In Windows Systems where dbgeng.dll is not present, 'Debugging Tools For Windows' needs to be installed to have these tools working. Also, \fP\f4PATH\fP\f3 environment variable should contain the location of \fP\f4jvm.dll\fP\f3 used by the target process or the location from which the Crash Dump file was produced.\fP
