     * <ul>
     * <li>The offset was obtained from {@link #objectFieldOffset} on
     * the {@link java.lang.reflect.Field} of some Java field and the object
     * referred to by <code>o</code> is of a class compatible with that
     * field's class.
     *
     * <li>The offset and object reference <code>o</code> (either null or
     * non-null) were both obtained via {@link #staticFieldOffset}
     * and {@link #staticFieldBase} (respectively) from the
     * reflective {@link Field} representation of some Java field.
     *
     * <li>The object referred to by <code>o</code> is an array, and the offset
     * is an integer of the form <code>B+N*S</code>, where <code>N</code> is
     * a valid index into the array, and <code>B</code> and <code>S</code> are
     * the values obtained by {@link #arrayBaseOffset} and {@link
     * #arrayIndexScale} (respectively) from the array's class.  The value
     * referred to is the <code>N</code><em>th</em> element of the array.
     *
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * If one of the above cases is true, the call references a specific Java
     * variable (field or array element).  However, the results are undefined
     * if that variable is not in fact of the type returned by this method.
     * <p>
     * This method refers to a variable by means of two parameters, and so
     * it provides (in effect) a <em>double-register</em> addressing mode
     * for Java variables.  When the object reference is null, this method
     * uses its offset as an absolute address.  This is similar in operation
     * to methods such as {@link #getInt(long)}, which provide (in effect) a
     * <em>single-register</em> addressing mode for non-Java variables.
     * However, because Java variables may have a different layout in memory
     * from non-Java variables, programmers should not assume that these
     * two addressing modes are ever equivalent.  Also, programmers should
     * remember that offsets from the double-register addressing mode cannot
     * be portably confused with longs used in the single-register addressing
     * mode.
