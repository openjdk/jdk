/**
 * An instance of this class is used to generate a stream of
 * pseudorandom numbers. The class uses a 48-bit seed, which is
 * modified using a linear congruential formula. (See Donald Knuth,
 * <i>The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 2</i>, Section 3.2.1.)
 * <p>
 * If two instances of {@code Random} are created with the same
 * seed, and the same sequence of method calls is made for each, they
 * will generate and return identical sequences of numbers. In order to
 * guarantee this property, particular algorithms are specified for the
 * class {@code Random}. Java implementations must use all the algorithms
 * shown here for the class {@code Random}, for the sake of absolute
 * portability of Java code. However, subclasses of class {@code Random}
 * are permitted to use other algorithms, so long as they adhere to the
 * general contracts for all the methods.
 * <p>
 * The algorithms implemented by class {@code Random} use a
 * {@code protected} utility method that on each invocation can supply
 * up to 32 pseudorandomly generated bits.
 * <p>
 * Many applications will find the method {@link Math#random} simpler to use.
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@code java.util.Random} are threadsafe.
 * However, the concurrent use of the same {@code java.util.Random}
 * instance across threads may encounter contention and consequent
 * poor performance. Consider instead using
 * {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadLocalRandom} in multithreaded
 * designs.
 *
 * <p>Instances of {@code java.util.Random} are not cryptographically
 * secure.  Consider instead using {@link java.security.SecureRandom} to
 * get a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator for use
 * by security-sensitive applications.
