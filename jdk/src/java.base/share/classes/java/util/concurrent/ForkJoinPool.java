/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s.
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the entry point for submissions
 * from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link
 * ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of employing
 * <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and
 * execute tasks submitted to the pool and/or created by other active
 * tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work if none exist). This
 * enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks
 * (as do most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small
 * tasks are submitted to the pool from external clients.  Especially
 * when setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in constructors, {@code
 * ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style
 * tasks that are never joined.
 *
 * <p>A static {@link #commonPool()} is available and appropriate for
 * most applications. The common pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that
 * is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the common
 * pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly
 * reclaimed during periods of non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent
 * use).
 *
 * <p>For applications that require separate or custom pools, a {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} may be constructed with a given target parallelism
 * level; by default, equal to the number of available processors.
 * The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available) threads
 * by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker
 * threads, even if some tasks are stalled waiting to join others.
 * However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face of blocked
 * I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested {@link
 * ManagedBlocker} interface enables extension of the kinds of
 * synchronization accommodated.
 *
 * <p>In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this
 * class provides status check methods (for example
 * {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing,
 * tuning, and monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method
 * {@link #toString} returns indications of pool state in a
 * convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p>As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three
 * main task execution methods summarized in the following table.
 * These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
 * engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool.  The main
 * forms of these methods accept instances of {@code ForkJoinTask},
 * but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well.  However,
 * tasks that are already executing in a pool should normally instead
 * use the within-computation forms listed in the table unless using
 * async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case
 * there is little difference among choice of methods.

 * <p>The common pool is by default constructed with default
 * parameters, but these may be controlled by setting three
 * {@linkplain System#getProperty system properties}:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.parallelism}
 * - the parallelism level, a non-negative integer
 * <li>{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.threadFactory}
 * - the class name of a {@link ForkJoinWorkerThreadFactory}
 * <li>{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.exceptionHandler}
 * - the class name of a {@link UncaughtExceptionHandler}
 * <li>{@code java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool.common.maximumSpares}
 * - the maximum number of allowed extra threads to maintain target
 * parallelism (default 256).
 * </ul>
 * If a {@link SecurityManager} is present and no factory is
 * specified, then the default pool uses a factory supplying
 * threads that have no {@link Permissions} enabled.
 * The system class loader is used to load these classes.
 * Upon any error in establishing these settings, default parameters
 * are used. It is possible to disable or limit the use of threads in
 * the common pool by setting the parallelism property to zero, and/or
 * using a factory that may return {@code null}. However doing so may
 * cause unjoined tasks to never be executed.
 *
 * <p><b>Implementation notes</b>: This implementation restricts the
 * maximum number of running threads to 32767. Attempts to create
 * pools with greater than the maximum number result in
 * {@code IllegalArgumentException}.
 *
 * <p>This implementation rejects submitted tasks (that is, by throwing
 * {@link RejectedExecutionException}) only when the pool is shut down
 * or internal resources have been exhausted.

     * Implementation Overview
     *
     * This class and its nested classes provide the main
     * functionality and control for a set of worker threads:
     * Submissions from non-FJ threads enter into submission queues.
     * Workers take these tasks and typically split them into subtasks
     * that may be stolen by other workers.  Preference rules give
     * first priority to processing tasks from their own queues (LIFO
     * or FIFO, depending on mode), then to randomized FIFO steals of
     * tasks in other queues.  This framework began as vehicle for
     * supporting tree-structured parallelism using work-stealing.
     * Over time, its scalability advantages led to extensions and
     * changes to better support more diverse usage contexts.  Because
     * most internal methods and nested classes are interrelated,
     * their main rationale and descriptions are presented here;
     * individual methods and nested classes contain only brief
     * comments about details.
     *
     * WorkQueues
     * ==========
     *
     * Most operations occur within work-stealing queues (in nested
     * class WorkQueue).  These are special forms of Deques that
     * support only three of the four possible end-operations -- push,
     * pop, and poll (aka steal), under the further constraints that
     * push and pop are called only from the owning thread (or, as
     * extended here, under a lock), while poll may be called from
     * other threads.  (If you are unfamiliar with them, you probably
     * want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book "The Art of
     * Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these in
     * more detail before proceeding.)  The main work-stealing queue
     * design is roughly similar to those in the papers "Dynamic
     * Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005
     * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and
     * "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael, Saraswat, and Vechev,
     * PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186).
     * The main differences ultimately stem from GC requirements that
     * we null out taken slots as soon as we can, to maintain as small
     * a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge
     * numbers of tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS
     * arbitrating pop vs poll (steal) from being on the indices
     * ("base" and "top") to the slots themselves.
     *
     * Adding tasks then takes the form of a classic array push(task):
     *    q.array[q.top] = task; ++q.top;
     *
     * (The actual code needs to null-check and size-check the array,
     * properly fence the accesses, and possibly signal waiting
     * workers to start scanning -- see below.)  Both a successful pop
     * and poll mainly entail a CAS of a slot from non-null to null.
     *
     * The pop operation (always performed by owner) is:
     *   if ((base != top) and
     *        (the task at top slot is not null) and
     *        (CAS slot to null))
     *           decrement top and return task;
     *
     * And the poll operation (usually by a stealer) is
     *    if ((base != top) and
     *        (the task at base slot is not null) and
     *        (base has not changed) and
     *        (CAS slot to null))
     *           increment base and return task;
     *
     * Because we rely on CASes of references, we do not need tag bits
     * on base or top.  They are simple ints as used in any circular
     * array-based queue (see for example ArrayDeque).  Updates to the
     * indices guarantee that top == base means the queue is empty,
     * but otherwise may err on the side of possibly making the queue
     * appear nonempty when a push, pop, or poll have not fully
     * committed. (Method isEmpty() checks the case of a partially
     * completed removal of the last element.)  Because of this, the
     * poll operation, considered individually, is not wait-free. One
     * thief cannot successfully continue until another in-progress
     * one (or, if previously empty, a push) completes.  However, in
     * the aggregate, we ensure at least probabilistic
     * non-blockingness.  If an attempted steal fails, a thief always
     * chooses a different random victim target to try next. So, in
     * order for one thief to progress, it suffices for any
     * in-progress poll or new push on any empty queue to
     * complete. (This is why we normally use method pollAt and its
     * variants that try once at the apparent base index, else
     * consider alternative actions, rather than method poll, which
     * retries.)
     *
     * This approach also enables support of a user mode in which
     * local task processing is in FIFO, not LIFO order, simply by
     * using poll rather than pop.  This can be useful in
     * message-passing frameworks in which tasks are never joined.
     * However neither mode considers affinities, loads, cache
     * localities, etc, so rarely provide the best possible
     * performance on a given machine, but portably provide good
     * throughput by averaging over these factors.  Further, even if
     * we did try to use such information, we do not usually have a
     * basis for exploiting it.  For example, some sets of tasks
     * profit from cache affinities, but others are harmed by cache
     * pollution effects. Additionally, even though it requires
     * scanning, long-term throughput is often best using random
     * selection rather than directed selection policies, so cheap
     * randomization of sufficient quality is used whenever
     * applicable.  Various Marsaglia XorShifts (some with different
     * shift constants) are inlined at use points.
     *
     * WorkQueues are also used in a similar way for tasks submitted
     * to the pool. We cannot mix these tasks in the same queues used
     * by workers. Instead, we randomly associate submission queues
     * with submitting threads, using a form of hashing.  The
     * ThreadLocalRandom probe value serves as a hash code for
     * choosing existing queues, and may be randomly repositioned upon
     * contention with other submitters.  In essence, submitters act
     * like workers except that they are restricted to executing local
     * tasks that they submitted (or in the case of CountedCompleters,
     * others with the same root task).  Insertion of tasks in shared
     * mode requires a lock (mainly to protect in the case of
     * resizing) but we use only a simple spinlock (using field
     * qlock), because submitters encountering a busy queue move on to
     * try or create other queues -- they block only when creating and
     * registering new queues. Additionally, "qlock" saturates to an
     * unlockable value (-1) at shutdown. Unlocking still can be and
     * is performed by cheaper ordered writes of "qlock" in successful
     * cases, but uses CAS in unsuccessful cases.
     *
     * Management
     * ==========
     *
     * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from
     * decentralized control -- workers mostly take tasks from
     * themselves or each other, at rates that can exceed a billion
     * per second.  The pool itself creates, activates (enables
     * scanning for and running tasks), deactivates, blocks, and
     * terminates threads, all with minimal central information.
     * There are only a few properties that we can globally track or
     * maintain, so we pack them into a small number of variables,
     * often maintaining atomicity without blocking or locking.
     * Nearly all essentially atomic control state is held in two
     * volatile variables that are by far most often read (not
     * written) as status and consistency checks. (Also, field
     * "config" holds unchanging configuration state.)
     *
     * Field "ctl" contains 64 bits holding information needed to
     * atomically decide to add, inactivate, enqueue (on an event
     * queue), dequeue, and/or re-activate workers.  To enable this
     * packing, we restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (which is
     * far in excess of normal operating range) to allow ids, counts,
     * and their negations (used for thresholding) to fit into 16bit
     * subfields.
     *
     * Field "runState" holds lockable state bits (STARTED, STOP, etc)
     * also protecting updates to the workQueues array.  When used as
     * a lock, it is normally held only for a few instructions (the
     * only exceptions are one-time array initialization and uncommon
     * resizing), so is nearly always available after at most a brief
     * spin. But to be extra-cautious, after spinning, method
     * awaitRunStateLock (called only if an initial CAS fails), uses a
     * wait/notify mechanics on a builtin monitor to block when
     * (rarely) needed. This would be a terrible idea for a highly
     * contended lock, but most pools run without the lock ever
     * contending after the spin limit, so this works fine as a more
     * conservative alternative. Because we don't otherwise have an
     * internal Object to use as a monitor, the "stealCounter" (an
     * AtomicLong) is used when available (it too must be lazily
     * initialized; see externalSubmit).
     *
     * Usages of "runState" vs "ctl" interact in only one case:
     * deciding to add a worker thread (see tryAddWorker), in which
     * case the ctl CAS is performed while the lock is held.
     *
     * Recording WorkQueues.  WorkQueues are recorded in the
     * "workQueues" array. The array is created upon first use (see
     * externalSubmit) and expanded if necessary.  Updates to the
     * array while recording new workers and unrecording terminated
     * ones are protected from each other by the runState lock, but
     * the array is otherwise concurrently readable, and accessed
     * directly. We also ensure that reads of the array reference
     * itself never become too stale. To simplify index-based
     * operations, the array size is always a power of two, and all
     * readers must tolerate null slots. Worker queues are at odd
     * indices. Shared (submission) queues are at even indices, up to
     * a maximum of 64 slots, to limit growth even if array needs to
     * expand to add more workers. Grouping them together in this way
     * simplifies and speeds up task scanning.
     *
     * All worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task
     * submissions, replacement of terminated workers, and/or
     * compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support
     * code is set up to work with other policies.  To ensure that we
     * do not hold on to worker references that would prevent GC, All
     * accesses to workQueues are via indices into the workQueues
     * array (which is one source of some of the messy code
     * constructions here). In essence, the workQueues array serves as
     * a weak reference mechanism. Thus for example the stack top
     * subfield of ctl stores indices, not references.
     *
     * Queuing Idle Workers. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we
     * cannot let workers spin indefinitely scanning for tasks when
     * none can be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume
     * workers unless there appear to be tasks available.  On the
     * other hand, we must quickly prod them into action when new
     * tasks are submitted or generated. In many usages, ramp-up time
     * to activate workers is the main limiting factor in overall
     * performance, which is compounded at program start-up by JIT
     * compilation and allocation. So we streamline this as much as
     * possible.
     *
     * The "ctl" field atomically maintains active and total worker
     * counts as well as a queue to place waiting threads so they can
     * be located for signalling. Active counts also play the role of
     * quiescence indicators, so are decremented when workers believe
     * that there are no more tasks to execute. The "queue" is
     * actually a form of Treiber stack.  A stack is ideal for
     * activating threads in most-recently used order. This improves
     * performance and locality, outweighing the disadvantages of
     * being prone to contention and inability to release a worker
     * unless it is topmost on stack.  We park/unpark workers after
     * pushing on the idle worker stack (represented by the lower
     * 32bit subfield of ctl) when they cannot find work.  The top
     * stack state holds the value of the "scanState" field of the
     * worker: its index and status, plus a version counter that, in
     * addition to the count subfields (also serving as version
     * stamps) provide protection against Treiber stack ABA effects.
     *
     * Field scanState is used by both workers and the pool to manage
     * and track whether a worker is INACTIVE (possibly blocked
     * waiting for a signal), or SCANNING for tasks (when neither hold
     * it is busy running tasks).  When a worker is inactivated, its
     * scanState field is set, and is prevented from executing tasks,
     * even though it must scan once for them to avoid queuing
     * races. Note that scanState updates lag queue CAS releases so
     * usage requires care. When queued, the lower 16 bits of
     * scanState must hold its pool index. So we place the index there
     * upon initialization (see registerWorker) and otherwise keep it
     * there or restore it when necessary.
     *
     * Memory ordering.  See "Correct and Efficient Work-Stealing for
     * Weak Memory Models" by Le, Pop, Cohen, and Nardelli, PPoPP 2013
     * (http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/readings/ppopp13.pdf) for an
     * analysis of memory ordering requirements in work-stealing
     * algorithms similar to the one used here.  We usually need
     * stronger than minimal ordering because we must sometimes signal
     * workers, requiring Dekker-like full-fences to avoid lost
     * signals.  Arranging for enough ordering without expensive
     * over-fencing requires tradeoffs among the supported means of
     * expressing access constraints. The most central operations,
     * taking from queues and updating ctl state, require full-fence
     * CAS.  Array slots are read using the emulation of volatiles
     * provided by Unsafe.  Access from other threads to WorkQueue
     * base, top, and array requires a volatile load of the first of
     * any of these read.  We use the convention of declaring the
     * "base" index volatile, and always read it before other fields.
     * The owner thread must ensure ordered updates, so writes use
     * ordered intrinsics unless they can piggyback on those for other
     * writes.  Similar conventions and rationales hold for other
     * WorkQueue fields (such as "currentSteal") that are only written
     * by owners but observed by others.
     *
     * Creating workers. To create a worker, we pre-increment total
     * count (serving as a reservation), and attempt to construct a
     * ForkJoinWorkerThread via its factory. Upon construction, the
     * new thread invokes registerWorker, where it constructs a
     * WorkQueue and is assigned an index in the workQueues array
     * (expanding the array if necessary). The thread is then
     * started. Upon any exception across these steps, or null return
     * from factory, deregisterWorker adjusts counts and records
     * accordingly.  If a null return, the pool continues running with
     * fewer than the target number workers. If exceptional, the
     * exception is propagated, generally to some external caller.
     * Worker index assignment avoids the bias in scanning that would
     * occur if entries were sequentially packed starting at the front
     * of the workQueues array. We treat the array as a simple
     * power-of-two hash table, expanding as needed. The seedIndex
     * increment ensures no collisions until a resize is needed or a
     * worker is deregistered and replaced, and thereafter keeps
     * probability of collision low. We cannot use
     * ThreadLocalRandom.getProbe() for similar purposes here because
     * the thread has not started yet, but do so for creating
     * submission queues for existing external threads.
     *
     * Deactivation and waiting. Queuing encounters several intrinsic
     * races; most notably that a task-producing thread can miss
     * seeing (and signalling) another thread that gave up looking for
     * work but has not yet entered the wait queue.  When a worker
     * cannot find a task to steal, it deactivates and enqueues. Very
     * often, the lack of tasks is transient due to GC or OS
     * scheduling. To reduce false-alarm deactivation, scanners
     * compute checksums of queue states during sweeps.  (The
     * stability checks used here and elsewhere are probabilistic
     * variants of snapshot techniques -- see Herlihy & Shavit.)
     * Workers give up and try to deactivate only after the sum is
     * stable across scans. Further, to avoid missed signals, they
     * repeat this scanning process after successful enqueuing until
     * again stable.  In this state, the worker cannot take/run a task
     * it sees until it is released from the queue, so the worker
     * itself eventually tries to release itself or any successor (see
     * tryRelease).  Otherwise, upon an empty scan, a deactivated
     * worker uses an adaptive local spin construction (see awaitWork)
     * before blocking (via park). Note the unusual conventions about
     * Thread.interrupts surrounding parking and other blocking:
     * Because interrupts are used solely to alert threads to check
     * termination, which is checked anyway upon blocking, we clear
     * status (using Thread.interrupted) before any call to park, so
     * that park does not immediately return due to status being set
     * via some other unrelated call to interrupt in user code.
     *
     * Signalling and activation.  Workers are created or activated
     * only when there appears to be at least one task they might be
     * able to find and execute.  Upon push (either by a worker or an
     * external submission) to a previously (possibly) empty queue,
     * workers are signalled if idle, or created if fewer exist than
     * the given parallelism level.  These primary signals are
     * buttressed by others whenever other threads remove a task from
     * a queue and notice that there are other tasks there as well.
     * On most platforms, signalling (unpark) overhead time is
     * noticeably long, and the time between signalling a thread and
     * it actually making progress can be very noticeably long, so it
     * is worth offloading these delays from critical paths as much as
     * possible. Also, because inactive workers are often rescanning
     * or spinning rather than blocking, we set and clear the "parker"
     * field of WorkQueues to reduce unnecessary calls to unpark.
     * (This requires a secondary recheck to avoid missed signals.)
     *
     * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of
     * use, a worker starting to wait when the pool is quiescent will
     * time out and terminate (see awaitWork) if the pool has remained
     * quiescent for period IDLE_TIMEOUT, increasing the period as the
     * number of threads decreases, eventually removing all workers.
     * Also, when more than two spare threads exist, excess threads
     * are immediately terminated at the next quiescent point.
     * (Padding by two avoids hysteresis.)
     *
     * Shutdown and Termination. A call to shutdownNow invokes
     * tryTerminate to atomically set a runState bit. The calling
     * thread, as well as every other worker thereafter terminating,
     * helps terminate others by setting their (qlock) status,
     * cancelling their unprocessed tasks, and waking them up, doing
     * so repeatedly until stable (but with a loop bounded by the
     * number of workers).  Calls to non-abrupt shutdown() preface
     * this by checking whether termination should commence. This
     * relies primarily on the active count bits of "ctl" maintaining
     * consensus -- tryTerminate is called from awaitWork whenever
     * quiescent. However, external submitters do not take part in
     * this consensus.  So, tryTerminate sweeps through queues (until
     * stable) to ensure lack of in-flight submissions and workers
     * about to process them before triggering the "STOP" phase of
     * termination. (Note: there is an intrinsic conflict if
     * helpQuiescePool is called when shutdown is enabled. Both wait
     * for quiescence, but tryTerminate is biased to not trigger until
     * helpQuiescePool completes.)
     *
     *
     * Joining Tasks
     * =============
     *
     * Any of several actions may be taken when one worker is waiting
     * to join a task stolen (or always held) by another.  Because we
     * are multiplexing many tasks on to a pool of workers, we can't
     * just let them block (as in Thread.join).  We also cannot just
     * reassign the joiner's run-time stack with another and replace
     * it later, which would be a form of "continuation", that even if
     * possible is not necessarily a good idea since we may need both
     * an unblocked task and its continuation to progress.  Instead we
     * combine two tactics:
     *
     *   Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it
     *      would be running if the steal had not occurred.
     *
     *   Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads,
     *      method tryCompensate() may create or re-activate a spare
     *      thread to compensate for blocked joiners until they unblock.
     *
     * A third form (implemented in tryRemoveAndExec) amounts to
     * helping a hypothetical compensator: If we can readily tell that
     * a possible action of a compensator is to steal and execute the
     * task being joined, the joining thread can do so directly,
     * without the need for a compensation thread (although at the
     * expense of larger run-time stacks, but the tradeoff is
     * typically worthwhile).
     *
     * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies
     * only on compensation in method awaitBlocker.
     *
     * The algorithm in helpStealer entails a form of "linear
     * helping".  Each worker records (in field currentSteal) the most
     * recent task it stole from some other worker (or a submission).
     * It also records (in field currentJoin) the task it is currently
     * actively joining. Method helpStealer uses these markers to try
     * to find a worker to help (i.e., steal back a task from and
     * execute it) that could hasten completion of the actively joined
     * task.  Thus, the joiner executes a task that would be on its
     * own local deque had the to-be-joined task not been stolen. This
     * is a conservative variant of the approach described in Wagner &
     * Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable technique for implementing
     * efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices, 1993
     * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs in
     * that: (1) We only maintain dependency links across workers upon
     * steals, rather than use per-task bookkeeping.  This sometimes
     * requires a linear scan of workQueues array to locate stealers,
     * but often doesn't because stealers leave hints (that may become
     * stale/wrong) of where to locate them.  It is only a hint
     * because a worker might have had multiple steals and the hint
     * records only one of them (usually the most current).  Hinting
     * isolates cost to when it is needed, rather than adding to
     * per-task overhead.  (2) It is "shallow", ignoring nesting and
     * potentially cyclic mutual steals.  (3) It is intentionally
     * racy: field currentJoin is updated only while actively joining,
     * which means that we miss links in the chain during long-lived
     * tasks, GC stalls etc (which is OK since blocking in such cases
     * is usually a good idea).  (4) We bound the number of attempts
     * to find work using checksums and fall back to suspending the
     * worker and if necessary replacing it with another.
     *
     * Helping actions for CountedCompleters do not require tracking
     * currentJoins: Method helpComplete takes and executes any task
     * with the same root as the task being waited on (preferring
     * local pops to non-local polls). However, this still entails
     * some traversal of completer chains, so is less efficient than
     * using CountedCompleters without explicit joins.
     *
     * Compensation does not aim to keep exactly the target
     * parallelism number of unblocked threads running at any given
     * time. Some previous versions of this class employed immediate
     * compensations for any blocked join. However, in practice, the
     * vast majority of blockages are transient byproducts of GC and
     * other JVM or OS activities that are made worse by replacement.
     * Currently, compensation is attempted only after validating that
     * all purportedly active threads are processing tasks by checking
     * field WorkQueue.scanState, which eliminates most false
     * positives.  Also, compensation is bypassed (tolerating fewer
     * threads) in the most common case in which it is rarely
     * beneficial: when a worker with an empty queue (thus no
     * continuation tasks) blocks on a join and there still remain
     * enough threads to ensure liveness.
     *
     * The compensation mechanism may be bounded.  Bounds for the
     * commonPool (see commonMaxSpares) better enable JVMs to cope
     * with programming errors and abuse before running out of
     * resources to do so. In other cases, users may supply factories
     * that limit thread construction. The effects of bounding in this
     * pool (like all others) is imprecise.  Total worker counts are
     * decremented when threads deregister, not when they exit and
     * resources are reclaimed by the JVM and OS. So the number of
     * simultaneously live threads may transiently exceed bounds.
     *
     * Common Pool
     * ===========
     *
     * The static common pool always exists after static
     * initialization.  Since it (or any other created pool) need
     * never be used, we minimize initial construction overhead and
     * footprint to the setup of about a dozen fields, with no nested
     * allocation. Most bootstrapping occurs within method
     * externalSubmit during the first submission to the pool.
     *
     * When external threads submit to the common pool, they can
     * perform subtask processing (see externalHelpComplete and
     * related methods) upon joins.  This caller-helps policy makes it
     * sensible to set common pool parallelism level to one (or more)
     * less than the total number of available cores, or even zero for
     * pure caller-runs.  We do not need to record whether external
     * submissions are to the common pool -- if not, external help
     * methods return quickly. These submitters would otherwise be
     * blocked waiting for completion, so the extra effort (with
     * liberally sprinkled task status checks) in inapplicable cases
     * amounts to an odd form of limited spin-wait before blocking in
     * ForkJoinTask.join.
     *
     * As a more appropriate default in managed environments, unless
     * overridden by system properties, we use workers of subclass
     * InnocuousForkJoinWorkerThread when there is a SecurityManager
     * present. These workers have no permissions set, do not belong
     * to any user-defined ThreadGroup, and erase all ThreadLocals
     * after executing any top-level task (see WorkQueue.runTask).
     * The associated mechanics (mainly in ForkJoinWorkerThread) may
     * be JVM-dependent and must access particular Thread class fields
     * to achieve this effect.
     *
     * Style notes
     * ===========
     *
     * Memory ordering relies mainly on Unsafe intrinsics that carry
     * the further responsibility of explicitly performing null- and
     * bounds- checks otherwise carried out implicitly by JVMs.  This
     * can be awkward and ugly, but also reflects the need to control
     * outcomes across the unusual cases that arise in very racy code
     * with very few invariants. So these explicit checks would exist
     * in some form anyway.  All fields are read into locals before
     * use, and null-checked if they are references.  This is usually
     * done in a "C"-like style of listing declarations at the heads
     * of methods or blocks, and using inline assignments on first
     * encounter.  Array bounds-checks are usually performed by
     * masking with array.length-1, which relies on the invariant that
     * these arrays are created with positive lengths, which is itself
     * paranoically checked. Nearly all explicit checks lead to
     * bypass/return, not exception throws, because they may
     * legitimately arise due to cancellation/revocation during
     * shutdown.
     *
     * There is a lot of representation-level coupling among classes
     * ForkJoinPool, ForkJoinWorkerThread, and ForkJoinTask.  The
     * fields of WorkQueue maintain data structures managed by
     * ForkJoinPool, so are directly accessed.  There is little point
     * trying to reduce this, since any associated future changes in
     * representations will need to be accompanied by algorithmic
     * changes anyway. Several methods intrinsically sprawl because
     * they must accumulate sets of consistent reads of fields held in
     * local variables.  There are also other coding oddities
     * (including several unnecessary-looking hoisted null checks)
     * that help some methods perform reasonably even when interpreted
     * (not compiled).
     *
     * The order of declarations in this file is (with a few exceptions):
     * (1) Static utility functions
     * (2) Nested (static) classes
     * (3) Static fields
     * (4) Fields, along with constants used when unpacking some of them
     * (5) Internal control methods
     * (6) Callbacks and other support for ForkJoinTask methods
     * (7) Exported methods
     * (8) Static block initializing statics in minimally dependent order

     * method, we ask users only about tradeoffs in overhead vs
     * expected throughput and its variance, rather than how finely to
     * partition tasks.
     *
     * In a steady state strict (tree-structured) computation, each
     * thread makes available for stealing enough tasks for other
     * threads to remain active. Inductively, if all threads play by
     * the same rules, each thread should make available only a
     * constant number of tasks.
     *
     * The minimum useful constant is just 1. But using a value of 1
     * would require immediate replenishment upon each steal to
     * maintain enough tasks, which is infeasible.  Further,
     * partitionings/granularities of offered tasks should minimize
     * steal rates, which in general means that threads nearer the top
     * of computation tree should generate more than those nearer the
     * bottom. In perfect steady state, each thread is at
     * approximately the same level of computation tree. However,
     * producing extra tasks amortizes the uncertainty of progress and
     * diffusion assumptions.
     *
     * So, users will want to use values larger (but not much larger)
     * than 1 to both smooth over transient shortages and hedge
     * against uneven progress; as traded off against the cost of
     * extra task overhead. We leave the user to pick a threshold
     * value to compare with the results of this call to guide
     * decisions, but recommend values such as 3.
     *
     * When all threads are active, it is on average OK to estimate
     * surplus strictly locally. In steady-state, if one thread is
     * maintaining say 2 surplus tasks, then so are others. So we can
     * just use estimated queue length.  However, this strategy alone
     * leads to serious mis-estimates in some non-steady-state
     * conditions (ramp-up, ramp-down, other stalls). We can detect
     * many of these by further considering the number of "idle"
     * threads, that are known to have zero queued tasks, so
     * compensate by a factor of (#idle/#active) threads.
