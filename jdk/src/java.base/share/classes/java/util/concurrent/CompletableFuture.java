/**
 * A {@link Future} that may be explicitly completed (setting its
 * value and status), and may be used as a {@link CompletionStage},
 * supporting dependent functions and actions that trigger upon its
 * completion.
 *
 * <p>When two or more threads attempt to
 * {@link #complete complete},
 * {@link #completeExceptionally completeExceptionally}, or
 * {@link #cancel cancel}
 * a CompletableFuture, only one of them succeeds.
 *
 * <p>In addition to these and related methods for directly
 * manipulating status and results, CompletableFuture implements
 * interface {@link CompletionStage} with the following policies: <ul>
 *
 * <li>Actions supplied for dependent completions of
 * <em>non-async</em> methods may be performed by the thread that
 * completes the current CompletableFuture, or by any other caller of
 * a completion method.
 *
 * <li>All <em>async</em> methods without an explicit Executor
 * argument are performed using the {@link ForkJoinPool#commonPool()}
 * (unless it does not support a parallelism level of at least two, in
 * which case, a new Thread is created to run each task).  This may be
 * overridden for non-static methods in subclasses by defining method
 * {@link #defaultExecutor()}. To simplify monitoring, debugging,
 * and tracking, all generated asynchronous tasks are instances of the
 * marker interface {@link AsynchronousCompletionTask}.  Operations
 * with time-delays can use adapter methods defined in this class, for
 * example: {@code supplyAsync(supplier, delayedExecutor(timeout,
 * timeUnit))}.  To support methods with delays and timeouts, this
 * class maintains at most one daemon thread for triggering and
 * cancelling actions, not for running them.
 *
 * <li>All CompletionStage methods are implemented independently of
 * other public methods, so the behavior of one method is not impacted
 * by overrides of others in subclasses.
 *
 * <li>All CompletionStage methods return CompletableFutures.  To
 * restrict usages to only those methods defined in interface
 * CompletionStage, use method {@link #minimalCompletionStage}. Or to
 * ensure only that clients do not themselves modify a future, use
 * method {@link #copy}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>CompletableFuture also implements {@link Future} with the following
 * policies: <ul>
 *
 * <li>Since (unlike {@link FutureTask}) this class has no direct
 * control over the computation that causes it to be completed,
 * cancellation is treated as just another form of exceptional
 * completion.  Method {@link #cancel cancel} has the same effect as
 * {@code completeExceptionally(new CancellationException())}. Method
 * {@link #isCompletedExceptionally} can be used to determine if a
 * CompletableFuture completed in any exceptional fashion.
 *
 * <li>In case of exceptional completion with a CompletionException,
 * methods {@link #get()} and {@link #get(long, TimeUnit)} throw an
 * {@link ExecutionException} with the same cause as held in the
 * corresponding CompletionException.  To simplify usage in most
 * contexts, this class also defines methods {@link #join()} and
 * {@link #getNow} that instead throw the CompletionException directly
 * in these cases.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Arguments used to pass a completion result (that is, for
 * parameters of type {@code T}) for methods accepting them may be
 * null, but passing a null value for any other parameter will result
 * in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.
 *
 * <p>Subclasses of this class should normally override the "virtual
 * constructor" method {@link #newIncompleteFuture}, which establishes
 * the concrete type returned by CompletionStage methods. For example,
 * here is a class that substitutes a different default Executor and
 * disables the {@code obtrude} methods:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * class MyCompletableFuture<T> extends CompletableFuture<T> {
 *   static final Executor myExecutor = ...;
 *   public MyCompletableFuture() { }
 *   public <U> CompletableFuture<U> newIncompleteFuture() {
 *     return new MyCompletableFuture<U>(); }
 *   public Executor defaultExecutor() {
 *     return myExecutor; }
 *   public void obtrudeValue(T value) {
 *     throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
 *   public void obtrudeException(Throwable ex) {
 *     throw new UnsupportedOperationException(); }
 * }}</pre>

    /*
     * Overview:
     *
     * A CompletableFuture may have dependent completion actions,
     * collected in a linked stack. It atomically completes by CASing
     * a result field, and then pops off and runs those actions. This
     * applies across normal vs exceptional outcomes, sync vs async
     * actions, binary triggers, and various forms of completions.
     *
     * Non-nullness of field result (set via CAS) indicates done.  An
     * AltResult is used to box null as a result, as well as to hold
     * exceptions.  Using a single field makes completion simple to
     * detect and trigger.  Encoding and decoding is straightforward
     * but adds to the sprawl of trapping and associating exceptions
     * with targets.  Minor simplifications rely on (static) NIL (to
     * box null results) being the only AltResult with a null
     * exception field, so we don't usually need explicit comparisons.
     * Even though some of the generics casts are unchecked (see
     * SuppressWarnings annotations), they are placed to be
     * appropriate even if checked.
     *
     * Dependent actions are represented by Completion objects linked
     * as Treiber stacks headed by field "stack". There are Completion
     * classes for each kind of action, grouped into single-input
     * (UniCompletion), two-input (BiCompletion), projected
     * (BiCompletions using either (not both) of two inputs), shared
     * (CoCompletion, used by the second of two sources), zero-input
     * source actions, and Signallers that unblock waiters. Class
     * Completion extends ForkJoinTask to enable async execution
     * (adding no space overhead because we exploit its "tag" methods
     * to maintain claims). It is also declared as Runnable to allow
     * usage with arbitrary executors.
     *
     * Support for each kind of CompletionStage relies on a separate
     * class, along with two CompletableFuture methods:
     *
     * * A Completion class with name X corresponding to function,
     *   prefaced with "Uni", "Bi", or "Or". Each class contains
     *   fields for source(s), actions, and dependent. They are
     *   boringly similar, differing from others only with respect to
     *   underlying functional forms. We do this so that users don't
     *   encounter layers of adapters in common usages.
     *
     * * Boolean CompletableFuture method x(...) (for example
     *   uniApply) takes all of the arguments needed to check that an
     *   action is triggerable, and then either runs the action or
     *   arranges its async execution by executing its Completion
     *   argument, if present. The method returns true if known to be
     *   complete.
     *
     * * Completion method tryFire(int mode) invokes the associated x
     *   method with its held arguments, and on success cleans up.
     *   The mode argument allows tryFire to be called twice (SYNC,
     *   then ASYNC); the first to screen and trap exceptions while
     *   arranging to execute, and the second when called from a
     *   task. (A few classes are not used async so take slightly
     *   different forms.)  The claim() callback suppresses function
     *   invocation if already claimed by another thread.
     *
     * * CompletableFuture method xStage(...) is called from a public
     *   stage method of CompletableFuture x. It screens user
     *   arguments and invokes and/or creates the stage object.  If
     *   not async and x is already complete, the action is run
     *   immediately.  Otherwise a Completion c is created, pushed to
     *   x's stack (unless done), and started or triggered via
     *   c.tryFire.  This also covers races possible if x completes
     *   while pushing.  Classes with two inputs (for example BiApply)
     *   deal with races across both while pushing actions.  The
     *   second completion is a CoCompletion pointing to the first,
     *   shared so that at most one performs the action.  The
     *   multiple-arity methods allOf and anyOf do this pairwise to
     *   form trees of completions.
     *
     * Note that the generic type parameters of methods vary according
     * to whether "this" is a source, dependent, or completion.
     *
     * Method postComplete is called upon completion unless the target
     * is guaranteed not to be observable (i.e., not yet returned or
     * linked). Multiple threads can call postComplete, which
     * atomically pops each dependent action, and tries to trigger it
     * via method tryFire, in NESTED mode.  Triggering can propagate
     * recursively, so NESTED mode returns its completed dependent (if
     * one exists) for further processing by its caller (see method
     * postFire).
     *
     * Blocking methods get() and join() rely on Signaller Completions
     * that wake up waiting threads.  The mechanics are similar to
     * Treiber stack wait-nodes used in FutureTask, Phaser, and
     * SynchronousQueue. See their internal documentation for
     * algorithmic details.
     *
     * Without precautions, CompletableFutures would be prone to
     * garbage accumulation as chains of Completions build up, each
     * pointing back to its sources. So we null out fields as soon as
     * possible.  The screening checks needed anyway harmlessly ignore
     * null arguments that may have been obtained during races with
     * threads nulling out fields.  We also try to unlink fired
     * Completions from stacks that might never be popped (see method
     * postFire).  Completion fields need not be declared as final or
     * volatile because they are only visible to other threads upon
     * safe publication.
