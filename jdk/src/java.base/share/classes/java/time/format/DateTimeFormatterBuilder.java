/**
 * Builder to create date-time formatters.
 * <p>
 * This allows a {@code DateTimeFormatter} to be created.
 * All date-time formatters are created ultimately using this builder.
 * <p>
 * The basic elements of date-time can all be added:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Value - a numeric value</li>
 * <li>Fraction - a fractional value including the decimal place. Always use this when
 * outputting fractions to ensure that the fraction is parsed correctly</li>
 * <li>Text - the textual equivalent for the value</li>
 * <li>OffsetId/Offset - the {@linkplain ZoneOffset zone offset}</li>
 * <li>ZoneId - the {@linkplain ZoneId time-zone} id</li>
 * <li>ZoneText - the name of the time-zone</li>
 * <li>ChronologyId - the {@linkplain Chronology chronology} id</li>
 * <li>ChronologyText - the name of the chronology</li>
 * <li>Literal - a text literal</li>
 * <li>Nested and Optional - formats can be nested or made optional</li>
 * </ul>
 * In addition, any of the elements may be decorated by padding, either with spaces or any other character.
 * <p>
 * Finally, a shorthand pattern, mostly compatible with {@code java.text.SimpleDateFormat SimpleDateFormat}
 * can be used, see {@link #appendPattern(String)}.
 * In practice, this simply parses the pattern and calls other methods on the builder.
 *

     * If the value of the field is negative then an exception is thrown during formatting.
     * <p>
     * This method supports a special technique of parsing known as 'adjacent value parsing'.
     * This technique solves the problem where a value, variable or fixed width, is followed by one or more
     * fixed length values. The standard parser is greedy, and thus it would normally
     * steal the digits that are needed by the fixed width value parsers that follow the
     * variable width one.
     * <p>
     * No action is required to initiate 'adjacent value parsing'.
     * When a call to {@code appendValue} is made, the builder
     * enters adjacent value parsing setup mode. If the immediately subsequent method
     * call or calls on the same builder are for a fixed width value, then the parser will reserve
     * space so that the fixed width values can be parsed.
     * <p>
     * For example, consider {@code builder.appendValue(YEAR).appendValue(MONTH_OF_YEAR, 2);}
     * The year is a variable width parse of between 1 and 19 digits.
     * The month is a fixed width parse of 2 digits.
     * Because these were appended to the same builder immediately after one another,
     * the year parser will reserve two digits for the month to parse.
     * Thus, the text '201106' will correctly parse to a year of 2011 and a month of 6.
     * Without adjacent value parsing, the year would greedily parse all six digits and leave
     * nothing for the month.
     * <p>
     * Adjacent value parsing applies to each set of fixed width not-negative values in the parser
     * that immediately follow any kind of value, variable or fixed width.
     * Calling any other append method will end the setup of adjacent value parsing.
     * Thus, in the unlikely event that you need to avoid adjacent value parsing behavior,
     * simply add the {@code appendValue} to another {@code DateTimeFormatterBuilder}
     * and add that to this builder.
     * <p>
     * If adjacent parsing is active, then parsing must match exactly the specified
     * number of digits in both strict and lenient modes.
     * In addition, no positive or negative sign is permitted.

     * Appends the reduced value of a date-time field to the formatter.
     * <p>
     * This is typically used for formatting and parsing a two digit year.
     * <p>
     * The base date is used to calculate the full value during parsing.
     * For example, if the base date is 1950-01-01 then parsed values for
     * a two digit year parse will be in the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
     * Only the year would be extracted from the date, thus a base date of
     * 1950-08-25 would also parse to the range 1950-01-01 to 2049-12-31.
     * This behavior is necessary to support fields such as week-based-year
     * or other calendar systems where the parsed value does not align with
     * standard ISO years.
     * <p>
     * The exact behavior is as follows. Parse the full set of fields and
     * determine the effective chronology using the last chronology if
     * it appears more than once. Then convert the base date to the
     * effective chronology. Then extract the specified field from the
     * chronology-specific base date and use it to determine the
     * {@code baseValue} used below.
     * <p>
     * For formatting, the {@code width} and {@code maxWidth} are used to
     * determine the number of characters to format.
     * If they are equal then the format is fixed width.
     * If the value of the field is within the range of the {@code baseValue} using
     * {@code width} characters then the reduced value is formatted otherwise the value is
     * truncated to fit {@code maxWidth}.
     * The rightmost characters are output to match the width, left padding with zero.
     * <p>
     * For strict parsing, the number of characters allowed by {@code width} to {@code maxWidth} are parsed.
     * For lenient parsing, the number of characters must be at least 1 and less than 10.
     * If the number of digits parsed is equal to {@code width} and the value is positive,
     * the value of the field is computed to be the first number greater than
     * or equal to the {@code baseValue} with the same least significant characters,
     * otherwise the value parsed is the field value.
     * This allows a reduced value to be entered for values in range of the baseValue
     * and width and absolute values can be entered for values outside the range.
     * <p>
     * For example, a base value of {@code 1980} and a width of {@code 2} will have
     * valid values from {@code 1980} to {@code 2079}.
     * During parsing, the text {@code "12"} will result in the value {@code 2012} as that
     * is the value within the range where the last two characters are "12".
     * By contrast, parsing the text {@code "1915"} will result in the value {@code 1915}.

     * units, each outputting a single field.
     * <p>
     * The parser may parse any piece of text from the input, storing the result
     * in the context. Typically, each individual parser will just parse one
     * field, such as the day-of-month, storing the value in the context.
     * Once the parse is complete, the caller will then resolve the parsed values
     * to create the desired object, such as a {@code LocalDate}.

     * The parse position will be updated during the parse. Parsing will start at
     * the specified index and the return value specifies the new parse position
     * for the next parser. If an error occurs, the returned index will be negative
     * and will have the error position encoded using the complement operator.
