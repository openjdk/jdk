     * A <em>lookup object</em> is a factory for creating method handles,

     * Method handles do not perform
     * access checks when they are called, but rather when they are created.
     * Therefore, method handle access
     * restrictions must be enforced when a method handle is created.
     * The caller class against which those restrictions are enforced
     * is known as the {@linkplain #lookupClass lookup class}.
     * <p>
     * A lookup class which needs to create method handles will call
     * {@link MethodHandles#lookup MethodHandles.lookup} to create a factory for itself.
     * When the {@code Lookup} factory object is created, the identity of the lookup class is
     * determined, and securely stored in the {@code Lookup} object.
     * The lookup class (or its delegates) may then use factory methods
     * on the {@code Lookup} object to create method handles for access-checked members.
     * This includes all methods, constructors, and fields which are allowed to the lookup class,
     * even private ones.
     *
     * <h1><a name="lookups"></a>Lookup Factory Methods</h1>
     * The factory methods on a {@code Lookup} object correspond to all major
     * use cases for methods, constructors, and fields.
     * Each method handle created by a factory method is the functional
     * equivalent of a particular <em>bytecode behavior</em>.
     * (Bytecode behaviors are described in section 5.4.3.5 of the Java Virtual Machine Specification.)
     * Here is a summary of the correspondence between these factory methods and
     * the behavior the resulting method handles:

     *
     * Here, the type {@code C} is the class or interface being searched for a member,
     * documented as a parameter named {@code refc} in the lookup methods.
     * The method type {@code MT} is composed from the return type {@code T}
     * and the sequence of argument types {@code A*}.
     * The constructor also has a sequence of argument types {@code A*} and
     * is deemed to return the newly-created object of type {@code C}.
     * Both {@code MT} and the field type {@code FT} are documented as a parameter named {@code type}.
     * The formal parameter {@code this} stands for the self-reference of type {@code C};
     * if it is present, it is always the leading argument to the method handle invocation.
     * (In the case of some {@code protected} members, {@code this} may be
     * restricted in type to the lookup class; see below.)
     * The name {@code arg} stands for all the other method handle arguments.
     * In the code examples for the Core Reflection API, the name {@code thisOrNull}
     * stands for a null reference if the accessed method or field is static,
     * and {@code this} otherwise.
     * The names {@code aMethod}, {@code aField}, and {@code aConstructor} stand
     * for reflective objects corresponding to the given members.
     * <p>
     * In cases where the given member is of variable arity (i.e., a method or constructor)
     * the returned method handle will also be of {@linkplain MethodHandle#asVarargsCollector variable arity}.
     * In all other cases, the returned method handle will be of fixed arity.
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <em>Discussion:</em>
     * The equivalence between looked-up method handles and underlying
     * class members and bytecode behaviors
     * can break down in a few ways:
     * <ul style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <li>If {@code C} is not symbolically accessible from the lookup class's loader,
     * the lookup can still succeed, even when there is no equivalent
     * Java expression or bytecoded constant.
     * <li>Likewise, if {@code T} or {@code MT}
     * is not symbolically accessible from the lookup class's loader,
     * the lookup can still succeed.
     * For example, lookups for {@code MethodHandle.invokeExact} and
     * {@code MethodHandle.invoke} will always succeed, regardless of requested type.
     * <li>If there is a security manager installed, it can forbid the lookup
     * on various grounds (<a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr">see below</a>).
     * By contrast, the {@code ldc} instruction on a {@code CONSTANT_MethodHandle}
     * constant is not subject to security manager checks.
     * <li>If the looked-up method has a
     * <a href="MethodHandle.html#maxarity">very large arity</a>,
     * the method handle creation may fail, due to the method handle
     * type having too many parameters.
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h1><a name="access"></a>Access checking</h1>
     * Access checks are applied in the factory methods of {@code Lookup},
     * when a method handle is created.
     * This is a key difference from the Core Reflection API, since
     * {@link java.lang.reflect.Method#invoke java.lang.reflect.Method.invoke}
     * performs access checking against every caller, on every call.
     * <p>
     * All access checks start from a {@code Lookup} object, which
     * compares its recorded lookup class against all requests to
     * create method handles.
     * A single {@code Lookup} object can be used to create any number
     * of access-checked method handles, all checked against a single
     * lookup class.
     * <p>
     * A {@code Lookup} object can be shared with other trusted code,
     * such as a metaobject protocol.
     * A shared {@code Lookup} object delegates the capability
     * to create method handles on private members of the lookup class.
     * Even if privileged code uses the {@code Lookup} object,
     * the access checking is confined to the privileges of the
     * original lookup class.
     * <p>
     * A lookup can fail, because
     * the containing class is not accessible to the lookup class, or
     * because the desired class member is missing, or because the
     * desired class member is not accessible to the lookup class, or
     * because the lookup object is not trusted enough to access the member.
     * In any of these cases, a {@code ReflectiveOperationException} will be
     * thrown from the attempted lookup.  The exact class will be one of
     * the following:
     * <ul>
     * <li>NoSuchMethodException &mdash; if a method is requested but does not exist
     * <li>NoSuchFieldException &mdash; if a field is requested but does not exist
     * <li>IllegalAccessException &mdash; if the member exists but an access check fails
     * </ul>
     * <p>
     * In general, the conditions under which a method handle may be
     * looked up for a method {@code M} are no more restrictive than the conditions
     * under which the lookup class could have compiled, verified, and resolved a call to {@code M}.
     * Where the JVM would raise exceptions like {@code NoSuchMethodError},
     * a method handle lookup will generally raise a corresponding
     * checked exception, such as {@code NoSuchMethodException}.
     * And the effect of invoking the method handle resulting from the lookup
     * is <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#equiv">exactly equivalent</a>
     * to executing the compiled, verified, and resolved call to {@code M}.
     * The same point is true of fields and constructors.
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <em>Discussion:</em>
     * Access checks only apply to named and reflected methods,
     * constructors, and fields.
     * Other method handle creation methods, such as
     * {@link MethodHandle#asType MethodHandle.asType},
     * do not require any access checks, and are used
     * independently of any {@code Lookup} object.
     * <p>
     * If the desired member is {@code protected}, the usual JVM rules apply,
     * including the requirement that the lookup class must be either be in the
     * same package as the desired member, or must inherit that member.
     * (See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, sections 4.9.2, 5.4.3.5, and 6.4.)
     * In addition, if the desired member is a non-static field or method
     * in a different package, the resulting method handle may only be applied
     * to objects of the lookup class or one of its subclasses.
     * This requirement is enforced by narrowing the type of the leading
     * {@code this} parameter from {@code C}
     * (which will necessarily be a superclass of the lookup class)
     * to the lookup class itself.
     * <p>
     * The JVM imposes a similar requirement on {@code invokespecial} instruction,
     * that the receiver argument must match both the resolved method <em>and</em>
     * the current class.  Again, this requirement is enforced by narrowing the
     * type of the leading parameter to the resulting method handle.
     * (See the Java Virtual Machine Specification, section 4.10.1.9.)
     * <p>
     * The JVM represents constructors and static initializer blocks as internal methods
     * with special names ({@code "<init>"} and {@code "<clinit>"}).
     * The internal syntax of invocation instructions allows them to refer to such internal
     * methods as if they were normal methods, but the JVM bytecode verifier rejects them.
     * A lookup of such an internal method will produce a {@code NoSuchMethodException}.
     * <p>
     * In some cases, access between nested classes is obtained by the Java compiler by creating
     * an wrapper method to access a private method of another class
     * in the same top-level declaration.
     * For example, a nested class {@code C.D}
     * can access private members within other related classes such as
     * {@code C}, {@code C.D.E}, or {@code C.B},
     * but the Java compiler may need to generate wrapper methods in
     * those related classes.  In such cases, a {@code Lookup} object on
     * {@code C.E} would be unable to those private members.
     * A workaround for this limitation is the {@link Lookup#in Lookup.in} method,
     * which can transform a lookup on {@code C.E} into one on any of those other
     * classes, without special elevation of privilege.
     * <p>
     * The accesses permitted to a given lookup object may be limited,
     * according to its set of {@link #lookupModes lookupModes},
     * to a subset of members normally accessible to the lookup class.
     * For example, the {@link MethodHandles#publicLookup publicLookup}
     * method produces a lookup object which is only allowed to access
     * public members in public classes.
     * The caller sensitive method {@link MethodHandles#lookup lookup}
     * produces a lookup object with full capabilities relative to
     * its caller class, to emulate all supported bytecode behaviors.
     * Also, the {@link Lookup#in Lookup.in} method may produce a lookup object
     * with fewer access modes than the original lookup object.
     *
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <a name="privacc"></a>
     * <em>Discussion of private access:</em>
     * We say that a lookup has <em>private access</em>
     * if its {@linkplain #lookupModes lookup modes}
     * include the possibility of accessing {@code private} members.
     * As documented in the relevant methods elsewhere,
     * only lookups with private access possess the following capabilities:
     * <ul style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <li>access private fields, methods, and constructors of the lookup class
     * <li>create method handles which invoke <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#callsens">caller sensitive</a> methods,
     *     such as {@code Class.forName}
     * <li>create method handles which {@link Lookup#findSpecial emulate invokespecial} instructions
     * <li>avoid <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#secmgr">package access checks</a>
     *     for classes accessible to the lookup class
     * <li>create {@link Lookup#in delegated lookup objects} which have private access to other classes
     *     within the same package member
     * </ul>
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * Each of these permissions is a consequence of the fact that a lookup object
     * with private access can be securely traced back to an originating class,
     * whose <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#equiv">bytecode behaviors</a> and Java language access permissions
     * can be reliably determined and emulated by method handles.
     *
     * <h1><a name="secmgr"></a>Security manager interactions</h1>
     * Although bytecode instructions can only refer to classes in
     * a related class loader, this API can search for methods in any
     * class, as long as a reference to its {@code Class} object is
     * available.  Such cross-loader references are also possible with the
     * Core Reflection API, and are impossible to bytecode instructions
     * such as {@code invokestatic} or {@code getfield}.
     * There is a {@linkplain java.lang.SecurityManager security manager API}
     * to allow applications to check such cross-loader references.
     * These checks apply to both the {@code MethodHandles.Lookup} API
     * and the Core Reflection API
     * (as found on {@link java.lang.Class Class}).
     * <p>
     * If a security manager is present, member lookups are subject to
     * additional checks.
     * From one to three calls are made to the security manager.
     * Any of these calls can refuse access by throwing a
     * {@link java.lang.SecurityException SecurityException}.
     * Define {@code smgr} as the security manager,
     * {@code lookc} as the lookup class of the current lookup object,
     * {@code refc} as the containing class in which the member
     * is being sought, and {@code defc} as the class in which the
     * member is actually defined.
     * The value {@code lookc} is defined as <em>not present</em>
     * if the current lookup object does not have
     * <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#privacc">private access</a>.
     * The calls are made according to the following rules:
     * <ul>
     * <li><b>Step 1:</b>
     *     If {@code lookc} is not present, or if its class loader is not
     *     the same as or an ancestor of the class loader of {@code refc},
     *     then {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     *     smgr.checkPackageAccess(refcPkg)} is called,
     *     where {@code refcPkg} is the package of {@code refc}.
     * <li><b>Step 2:</b>
     *     If the retrieved member is not public and
     *     {@code lookc} is not present, then
     *     {@link SecurityManager#checkPermission smgr.checkPermission}
     *     with {@code RuntimePermission("accessDeclaredMembers")} is called.
     * <li><b>Step 3:</b>
     *     If the retrieved member is not public,
     *     and if {@code lookc} is not present,
     *     and if {@code defc} and {@code refc} are different,
     *     then {@link SecurityManager#checkPackageAccess
     *     smgr.checkPackageAccess(defcPkg)} is called,
     *     where {@code defcPkg} is the package of {@code defc}.
     * </ul>
     * Security checks are performed after other access checks have passed.
     * Therefore, the above rules presuppose a member that is public,
     * or else that is being accessed from a lookup class that has
     * rights to access the member.
     *
     * <h1><a name="callsens"></a>Caller sensitive methods</h1>
     * A small number of Java methods have a special property called caller sensitivity.
     * A <em>caller-sensitive</em> method can behave differently depending on the
     * identity of its immediate caller.
     * <p>
     * If a method handle for a caller-sensitive method is requested,
     * the general rules for <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#equiv">bytecode behaviors</a> apply,
     * but they take account of the lookup class in a special way.
     * The resulting method handle behaves as if it were called
     * from an instruction contained in the lookup class,
     * so that the caller-sensitive method detects the lookup class.
     * (By contrast, the invoker of the method handle is disregarded.)
     * Thus, in the case of caller-sensitive methods,
     * different lookup classes may give rise to
     * differently behaving method handles.
     * <p>
     * In cases where the lookup object is
     * {@link MethodHandles#publicLookup() publicLookup()},
     * or some other lookup object without
     * <a href="MethodHandles.Lookup.html#privacc">private access</a>,
     * the lookup class is disregarded.
     * In such cases, no caller-sensitive method handle can be created,
     * access is forbidden, and the lookup fails with an
     * {@code IllegalAccessException}.
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * <em>Discussion:</em>
     * For example, the caller-sensitive method
     * {@link java.lang.Class#forName(String) Class.forName(x)}
     * can return varying classes or throw varying exceptions,
     * depending on the class loader of the class that calls it.
     * A public lookup of {@code Class.forName} will fail, because
     * there is no reasonable way to determine its bytecode behavior.
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * If an application caches method handles for broad sharing,
     * it should use {@code publicLookup()} to create them.
     * If there is a lookup of {@code Class.forName}, it will fail,
     * and the application must take appropriate action in that case.
     * It may be that a later lookup, perhaps during the invocation of a
     * bootstrap method, can incorporate the specific identity
     * of the caller, making the method accessible.
     * <p style="font-size:smaller;">
     * The function {@code MethodHandles.lookup} is caller sensitive
     * so that there can be a secure foundation for lookups.
     * Nearly all other methods in the JSR 292 API rely on lookup
     * objects to check access requests.

     * <ul>
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> are references, and <em>T1</em> is an interface type,

     *     (This treatment of interfaces follows the usage of the bytecode verifier.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is boolean and <em>T1</em> is another primitive,
     *     the boolean is converted to a byte value, 1 for true, 0 for false.
     *     (This treatment follows the usage of the bytecode verifier.)
     * <li>If <em>T1</em> is boolean and <em>T0</em> is another primitive,
     *     <em>T0</em> is converted to byte via Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5),
     *     and the low order bit of the result is tested, as if by {@code (x & 1) != 0}.
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> and <em>T1</em> are primitives other than boolean,
     *     then a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) is applied.
     *     (Specifically, <em>T0</em> will convert to <em>T1</em> by
     *     widening and/or narrowing.)
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is a reference and <em>T1</em> a primitive, an unboxing
     *     conversion will be applied at runtime, possibly followed
     *     by a Java casting conversion (JLS 5.5) on the primitive value,
     *     possibly followed by a conversion from byte to boolean by testing
     *     the low-order bit.
     * <li>If <em>T0</em> is a reference and <em>T1</em> a primitive,
