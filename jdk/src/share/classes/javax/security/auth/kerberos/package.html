    This package contains utility classes related to the Kerberos network
    authentication protocol. They do not provide much Kerberos support
    themselves.<p>

    The Kerberos network authentication protocol is defined in 
    <a href=http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4120.txt>RFC 4120</a>. The Java
    platform contains support for the client side of Kerberos via the 
    {@link org.ietf.jgss} package. There might also be 
    a login module that implements
    {@link javax.security.auth.spi.LoginModule LoginModule} to authenticate 
    Kerberos principals.<p>

    You can provide the name of your default realm and Key Distribution
    Center (KDC) host for that realm using the system properties
    java.security.krb5.realm and java.security.krb5.kdc. Alternatively, you 
    can provide an MIT style configuration file called krb5.conf in
    &lt;java-home&gt;/lib/security. If you place this file elsewhere, you can
    indicate that location via the system property java.security.krb5.conf.<p>
