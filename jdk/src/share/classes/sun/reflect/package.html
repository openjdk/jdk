<B> Licensee impact of JDK 1.4 reflection changes </B>

</P>
<P>

Sun's JDK 1.4 contains a new implementation of java.lang.reflect which
offers substantially higher performance than previous JDKs' native
code. Licensees can at their discretion port these changes. There are
no public API or documentation changes associated with the new
reflection implementation aside from a few minor clarifications in the
specifications of Method.invoke(), Constructor.newInstance(), and a
few methods in java.lang.reflect.Field.

</P>
<P>

The bulk of the new implementation is Java programming language code
which generates bytecodes, and is therefore portable. If licensees
desire to port it, the following JVM changes are required:

<OL>
<LI> The following four new JVM entry points must be added:

 <UL>
 <LI> JVM_GetClassDeclaredConstructors
 <LI> JVM_GetClassDeclaredFields
 <LI> JVM_GetClassDeclaredMethods
 <LI> JVM_GetClassAccessFlags
 </UL>

The first three return the declared constructors, fields, and methods
for a given class, with an option to return only the public ones. They
are similar in functionality to the earlier GetClassConstructors,
GetClassFields, and GetClassMethods.  JVM_GetClassDeclaredFields and
JVM_GetClassDeclaredMethods must intern the Strings for the names of
the Field and Method objects returned. The fouth returns the access
flags for a given class as marked in the class file, as opposed to in
the InnerClasses attribute if the class is an inner class, and
therefore differs from JVM_GetClassModifiers for inner classes (most
importantly, protected inner classes; see 4471811.)

<LI> The JVM's link resolver must be modified to allow all field and
method references from subclasses of sun.reflect.MagicAccessorImpl to
any other class (even to private members of other classes) to
succeed. This allows setAccessible() and its associated checks to be
implemented in Java.

<LI> The code which calls the verifier must skip verification for all
subclasses of sun.reflect.MagicAccessorImpl. (It was originally
intended that only a subset of the stub classes used for serialization
would not pass the verifier, specifically, those subclassing
SerializationConstructorAccessorImpl; see 4486457 for a case where
this does not work.)

<LI> The stack walker for security checks must be modified to skip not
only all Method.invoke() frames, but also any frames for which the
class is a subclass of sun.reflect.MethodAccessorImpl.

<LI> The JVM entry points JVM_InvokeMethod and
JVM_NewInstanceFromConstructor are currently still used because the
first invocation of the bytecode-based reflection is currently slower
than the original native code. The security checks they perform can,
however, be disabled, as they are now performed by Java programming
language code.

</OL>

</P>
<P>

The following changes were discovered to be necessary for backward
compatibility with certain applications (see bug 4474172):

<OL>

<LI> The existing JVM entry point JVM_LatestUserDefinedLoader
(typically used in applications which rely on the 1.1 security
framework) must skip reflection-related frames in its stack walk:
specifically all frames associated with subclasses of
sun.reflect.MethodAccessorImpl and
sun.reflect.ConstructorAccessorImpl.

<LI> The new reflection implementation can cause class loading to
occur in previously-unexpected places (namely during reflective
calls).  This can cause class loaders which contain subtle bugs to
break.  In general it is not possible to guarantee complete backward
bug compatibility, but one kind of bug has been observed more than
once: the inability of a user-defined loader to handle delegation to
it for a class it has already loaded. The new reflection
implementation is predicated on delegation working properly, as it
loads stub classes into newly-fabricated class loaders of type
sun.reflect.DelegatingClassLoader, one stub class per loader, to allow
unloading of the stub classes to occur more quickly. To handle this
kind of bug, the JVM's internal class lookup mechanism must be
slightly modified to check for instances of
sun.reflect.DelegatingClassLoader as the incoming class loader and
silently traverse the "parent" field once for such loaders before
entering the bulk of the resolution code. This avoids an upcall to
Java programming language code which certain loaders can not handle.

</OL>

</P>
<P>

The following JVM entry points may be deleted:

<UL>
<LI> JVM_GetClassFields
<LI> JVM_GetClassMethods
<LI> JVM_GetClassConstructors
<LI> JVM_GetClassField
<LI> JVM_GetClassMethod
<LI> JVM_GetClassConstructor
<LI> JVM_NewInstance
<LI> JVM_GetField
<LI> JVM_GetPrimitiveField
<LI> JVM_SetField
<LI> JVM_SetPrimitiveField
</UL>

</P>
<P>

To keep using the previous reflection implementation, licensees should
not take changes from Sun's JDK 1.4 relating specifically to the
implementation of reflection in the following classes/methods and
any associated native code:

<UL>
<LI> java.lang.Class.newInstance0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getClassLoader0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getFields
<LI> java.lang.Class.getMethods
<LI> java.lang.Class.getDeclaredFields
<LI> java.lang.Class.getDeclaredMethods
<LI> java.lang.Class.getFields0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getMethods0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getConstructors0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getField0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getMethod0
<LI> java.lang.Class.getConstructor0
<LI> java.lang.ClassLoader.getCallerClassLoader
<LI> java.lang.System.getCallerClass
<LI> java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject
<LI> java.lang.reflect.Constructor
<LI> java.lang.reflect.Field
<LI> java.lang.reflect.Method
<LI> java.lang.reflect.Modifier
<LI> sun.misc.ClassReflector
</UL>
