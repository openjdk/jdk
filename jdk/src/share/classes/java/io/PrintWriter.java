/**
 * Prints formatted representations of objects to a text-output stream.  This

 * PrintStream}.  It does not contain methods for writing raw bytes, for which
 * a program should use unencoded byte streams.
 *
 * <p> Unlike the {@link PrintStream} class, if automatic flushing is enabled
 * it will be done only when one of the <tt>println</tt>, <tt>printf</tt>, or
 * <tt>format</tt> methods is invoked, rather than whenever a newline character
 * happens to be output.  These methods use the platform's own notion of line
 * separator rather than the newline character.
 *
 * <p> Methods in this class never throw I/O exceptions, although some of its
 * constructors may.  The client may inquire as to whether any errors have
 * occurred by invoking {@link #checkError checkError()}.
