/**
 * This class represents an observable object, or "data"
 * in the model-view paradigm. It can be subclassed to represent an
 * object that the application wants to have observed.
 * <p>
 * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer
 * may be any object that implements interface <tt>Observer</tt>. After an
 * observable instance changes, an application calling the
 * <code>Observable</code>'s <code>notifyObservers</code> method
 * causes all of its observers to be notified of the change by a call
 * to their <code>update</code> method.
 * <p>
 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified.
 * The default implementation provided in the Observable class will
 * notify Observers in the order in which they registered interest, but
 * subclasses may change this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver
 * notifications on separate threads, or may guarantee that their
 * subclass follows this order, as they choose.
 * <p>
 * Note that this notification mechanism is has nothing to do with threads
 * and is completely separate from the <tt>wait</tt> and <tt>notify</tt>
 * mechanism of class <tt>Object</tt>.
 * <p>
 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is
 * empty. Two observers are considered the same if and only if the
 * <tt>equals</tt> method returns true for them.
