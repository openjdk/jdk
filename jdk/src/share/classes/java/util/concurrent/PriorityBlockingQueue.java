/**
 * An unbounded {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} that uses
 * the same ordering rules as class {@link PriorityQueue} and supplies
 * blocking retrieval operations.  While this queue is logically
 * unbounded, attempted additions may fail due to resource exhaustion
 * (causing <tt>OutOfMemoryError</tt>). This class does not permit
 * <tt>null</tt> elements.  A priority queue relying on {@linkplain
 * Comparable natural ordering} also does not permit insertion of
 * non-comparable objects (doing so results in
 * <tt>ClassCastException</tt>).
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.  The Iterator provided in method {@link
 * #iterator()} is <em>not</em> guaranteed to traverse the elements of
 * the PriorityBlockingQueue in any particular order. If you need
 * ordered traversal, consider using
 * <tt>Arrays.sort(pq.toArray())</tt>.  Also, method <tt>drainTo</tt>
 * can be used to <em>remove</em> some or all elements in priority
 * order and place them in another collection.
 *
 * <p>Operations on this class make no guarantees about the ordering
 * of elements with equal priority. If you need to enforce an
 * ordering, you can define custom classes or comparators that use a
 * secondary key to break ties in primary priority values.  For
 * example, here is a class that applies first-in-first-out
 * tie-breaking to comparable elements. To use it, you would insert a
 * <tt>new FIFOEntry(anEntry)</tt> instead of a plain entry object.
 *
 * <pre>
 * class FIFOEntry&lt;E extends Comparable&lt;? super E&gt;&gt;
 *     implements Comparable&lt;FIFOEntry&lt;E&gt;&gt; {
 *   final static AtomicLong seq = new AtomicLong();
 *   final long seqNum;
 *   final E entry;
 *   public FIFOEntry(E entry) {
 *     seqNum = seq.getAndIncrement();
 *     this.entry = entry;
 *   }
 *   public E getEntry() { return entry; }
 *   public int compareTo(FIFOEntry&lt;E&gt; other) {
 *     int res = entry.compareTo(other.entry);
 *     if (res == 0 &amp;&amp; other.entry != this.entry)
 *       res = (seqNum &lt; other.seqNum ? -1 : 1);
 *     return res;
 *   }
