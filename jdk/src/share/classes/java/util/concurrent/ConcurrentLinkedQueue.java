/**
 * An unbounded thread-safe {@linkplain Queue queue} based on linked nodes.
 * This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).
 * The <em>head</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
 * queue the longest time.
 * The <em>tail</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
 * queue the shortest time. New elements
 * are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
 * operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
 * A {@code ConcurrentLinkedQueue} is an appropriate choice when
 * many threads will share access to a common collection.
 * Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class
 * does not permit the use of {@code null} elements.
 *
 * <p>This implementation employs an efficient &quot;wait-free&quot;
 * algorithm based on one described in <a
 * href="http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/michael/PODC96.html"> Simple,
 * Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue
 * Algorithms</a> by Maged M. Michael and Michael L. Scott.
 *
 * <p>Iterators are <i>weakly consistent</i>, returning elements
 * reflecting the state of the queue at some point at or since the
 * creation of the iterator.  They do <em>not</em> throw {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}, and may proceed concurrently with
 * other operations.  Elements contained in the queue since the creation
 * of the iterator will be returned exactly once.
 *
 * <p>Beware that, unlike in most collections, the {@code size} method
 * is <em>NOT</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the
 * asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number
 * of elements requires a traversal of the elements.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the <em>optional</em>
 * methods of the {@link Queue} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
 * collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 * {@code ConcurrentLinkedQueue}
 * <a href="package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility"><i>happen-before</i></a>
 * actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
 * the {@code ConcurrentLinkedQueue} in another thread.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

    /*
     * This is a modification of the Michael & Scott algorithm,
     * adapted for a garbage-collected environment, with support for
     * interior node deletion (to support remove(Object)).  For
     * explanation, read the paper.
     *
     * Note that like most non-blocking algorithms in this package,
     * this implementation relies on the fact that in garbage
     * collected systems, there is no possibility of ABA problems due
     * to recycled nodes, so there is no need to use "counted
     * pointers" or related techniques seen in versions used in
     * non-GC'ed settings.
     *
     * The fundamental invariants are:
     * - There is exactly one (last) Node with a null next reference,
     *   which is CASed when enqueueing.  This last Node can be
     *   reached in O(1) time from tail, but tail is merely an
     *   optimization - it can always be reached in O(N) time from
     *   head as well.
     * - The elements contained in the queue are the non-null items in
     *   Nodes that are reachable from head.  CASing the item
     *   reference of a Node to null atomically removes it from the
     *   queue.  Reachability of all elements from head must remain
     *   true even in the case of concurrent modifications that cause
     *   head to advance.  A dequeued Node may remain in use
     *   indefinitely due to creation of an Iterator or simply a
     *   poll() that has lost its time slice.
     *
     * The above might appear to imply that all Nodes are GC-reachable
     * from a predecessor dequeued Node.  That would cause two problems:
     * - allow a rogue Iterator to cause unbounded memory retention
     * - cause cross-generational linking of old Nodes to new Nodes if
     *   a Node was tenured while live, which generational GCs have a
     *   hard time dealing with, causing repeated major collections.
     * However, only non-deleted Nodes need to be reachable from
     * dequeued Nodes, and reachability does not necessarily have to
     * be of the kind understood by the GC.  We use the trick of
     * linking a Node that has just been dequeued to itself.  Such a
     * self-link implicitly means to advance to head.
     *
     * Both head and tail are permitted to lag.  In fact, failing to
     * update them every time one could is a significant optimization
     * (fewer CASes). As with LinkedTransferQueue (see the internal
     * documentation for that class), we use a slack threshold of two;
     * that is, we update head/tail when the current pointer appears
     * to be two or more steps away from the first/last node.
     *
     * Since head and tail are updated concurrently and independently,
     * it is possible for tail to lag behind head (why not)?
     *
     * CASing a Node's item reference to null atomically removes the
     * element from the queue.  Iterators skip over Nodes with null
     * items.  Prior implementations of this class had a race between
     * poll() and remove(Object) where the same element would appear
     * to be successfully removed by two concurrent operations.  The
     * method remove(Object) also lazily unlinks deleted Nodes, but
     * this is merely an optimization.
     *
     * When constructing a Node (before enqueuing it) we avoid paying
     * for a volatile write to item by using Unsafe.putObject instead
     * of a normal write.  This allows the cost of enqueue to be
     * "one-and-a-half" CASes.
     *
     * Both head and tail may or may not point to a Node with a
     * non-null item.  If the queue is empty, all items must of course
     * be null.  Upon creation, both head and tail refer to a dummy
     * Node with null item.  Both head and tail are only updated using
     * CAS, so they never regress, although again this is merely an
     * optimization.
