/**
 * An optionally-bounded {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} based on
 * linked nodes.
 * This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).
 * The <em>head</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
 * queue the longest time.
 * The <em>tail</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
 * queue the shortest time. New elements
 * are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
 * operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
 * Linked queues typically have higher throughput than array-based queues but
 * less predictable performance in most concurrent applications.
 *
 * <p> The optional capacity bound constructor argument serves as a
 * way to prevent excessive queue expansion. The capacity, if unspecified,
 * is equal to {@link Integer#MAX_VALUE}.  Linked nodes are
 * dynamically created upon each insertion unless this would bring the
 * queue above capacity.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

     * A variant of the "two lock queue" algorithm.  The putLock gates
     * entry to put (and offer), and has an associated condition for
     * waiting puts.  Similarly for the takeLock.  The "count" field
     * that they both rely on is maintained as an atomic to avoid
     * needing to get both locks in most cases. Also, to minimize need
     * for puts to get takeLock and vice-versa, cascading notifies are
     * used. When a put notices that it has enabled at least one take,
     * it signals taker. That taker in turn signals others if more
     * items have been entered since the signal. And symmetrically for
     * takes signalling puts. Operations such as remove(Object) and
     * iterators acquire both locks.
     *
     * Visibility between writers and readers is provided as follows:
     *
     * Whenever an element is enqueued, the putLock is acquired and
     * count updated.  A subsequent reader guarantees visibility to the
     * enqueued Node by either acquiring the putLock (via fullyLock)
     * or by acquiring the takeLock, and then reading n = count.get();
     * this gives visibility to the first n items.
     *
     * To implement weakly consistent iterators, it appears we need to
     * keep all Nodes GC-reachable from a predecessor dequeued Node.
     * That would cause two problems:
     * - allow a rogue Iterator to cause unbounded memory retention
     * - cause cross-generational linking of old Nodes to new Nodes if
     *   a Node was tenured while live, which generational GCs have a
     *   hard time dealing with, causing repeated major collections.
     * However, only non-deleted Nodes need to be reachable from
     * dequeued Nodes, and reachability does not necessarily have to
     * be of the kind understood by the GC.  We use the trick of
     * linking a Node that has just been dequeued to itself.  Such a
     * self-link implicitly means to advance to head.next.
