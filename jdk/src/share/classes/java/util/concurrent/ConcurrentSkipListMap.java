/**
 * A scalable concurrent {@link ConcurrentNavigableMap} implementation.
 * The map is sorted according to the {@linkplain Comparable natural
 * ordering} of its keys, or by a {@link Comparator} provided at map
 * creation time, depending on which constructor is used.
 *
 * <p>This class implements a concurrent variant of <a
 * href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skip_list" target="_top">SkipLists</a>
 * providing expected average <i>log(n)</i> time cost for the
 * <tt>containsKey</tt>, <tt>get</tt>, <tt>put</tt> and
 * <tt>remove</tt> operations and their variants.  Insertion, removal,
 * update, and access operations safely execute concurrently by
 * multiple threads.  Iterators are <i>weakly consistent</i>, returning
 * elements reflecting the state of the map at some point at or since
 * the creation of the iterator.  They do <em>not</em> throw {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}, and may proceed concurrently with
 * other operations. Ascending key ordered views and their iterators
 * are faster than descending ones.
 *
 * <p>All <tt>Map.Entry</tt> pairs returned by methods in this class
 * and its views represent snapshots of mappings at the time they were
 * produced. They do <em>not</em> support the <tt>Entry.setValue</tt>
 * method. (Note however that it is possible to change mappings in the
 * associated map using <tt>put</tt>, <tt>putIfAbsent</tt>, or
 * <tt>replace</tt>, depending on exactly which effect you need.)
 *
 * <p>Beware that, unlike in most collections, the <tt>size</tt>
 * method is <em>not</em> a constant-time operation. Because of the
 * asynchronous nature of these maps, determining the current number
 * of elements requires a traversal of the elements.  Additionally,
 * the bulk operations <tt>putAll</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and
 * <tt>clear</tt> are <em>not</em> guaranteed to be performed
 * atomically. For example, an iterator operating concurrently with a
 * <tt>putAll</tt> operation might view only some of the added
 * elements.
 *
 * <p>This class and its views and iterators implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Map} and {@link Iterator}
 * interfaces. Like most other concurrent collections, this class does
 * <em>not</em> permit the use of <tt>null</tt> keys or values because some
 * null return values cannot be reliably distinguished from the absence of
 * elements.
 *

     * This class implements a tree-like two-dimensionally linked skip
     * list in which the index levels are represented in separate
     * nodes from the base nodes holding data.  There are two reasons
     * for taking this approach instead of the usual array-based
     * structure: 1) Array based implementations seem to encounter
     * more complexity and overhead 2) We can use cheaper algorithms
     * for the heavily-traversed index lists than can be used for the

     * The base lists use a variant of the HM linked ordered set
     * algorithm. See Tim Harris, "A pragmatic implementation of
     * non-blocking linked lists"
     * http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~tlh20/publications.html and Maged
     * Michael "High Performance Dynamic Lock-Free Hash Tables and
     * List-Based Sets"
     * http://www.research.ibm.com/people/m/michael/pubs.htm.  The
     * basic idea in these lists is to mark the "next" pointers of
     * deleted nodes when deleting to avoid conflicts with concurrent
     * insertions, and when traversing to keep track of triples
     * (predecessor, node, successor) in order to detect when and how
     * to unlink these deleted nodes.
     *
     * Rather than using mark-bits to mark list deletions (which can
     * be slow and space-intensive using AtomicMarkedReference), nodes
     * use direct CAS'able next pointers.  On deletion, instead of
     * marking a pointer, they splice in another node that can be
     * thought of as standing for a marked pointer (indicating this by
     * using otherwise impossible field values).  Using plain nodes
     * acts roughly like "boxed" implementations of marked pointers,
     * but uses new nodes only when nodes are deleted, not for every
     * link.  This requires less space and supports faster
     * traversal. Even if marked references were better supported by
     * JVMs, traversal using this technique might still be faster
     * because any search need only read ahead one more node than
     * otherwise required (to check for trailing marker) rather than
     * unmasking mark bits or whatever on each read.
     *
     * This approach maintains the essential property needed in the HM
     * algorithm of changing the next-pointer of a deleted node so
     * that any other CAS of it will fail, but implements the idea by
     * changing the pointer to point to a different node, not by
     * marking it.  While it would be possible to further squeeze
     * space by defining marker nodes not to have key/value fields, it
     * isn't worth the extra type-testing overhead.  The deletion
     * markers are rarely encountered during traversal and are
     * normally quickly garbage collected. (Note that this technique
     * would not work well in systems without garbage collection.)
     *
     * In addition to using deletion markers, the lists also use
     * nullness of value fields to indicate deletion, in a style
     * similar to typical lazy-deletion schemes.  If a node's value is
     * null, then it is considered logically deleted and ignored even
     * though it is still reachable. This maintains proper control of
     * concurrent replace vs delete operations -- an attempted replace
     * must fail if a delete beat it by nulling field, and a delete
     * must return the last non-null value held in the field. (Note:
     * Null, rather than some special marker, is used for value fields
     * here because it just so happens to mesh with the Map API
     * requirement that method get returns null if there is no
     * mapping, which allows nodes to remain concurrently readable
     * even when deleted. Using any other marker value here would be
     * messy at best.)
     *
     * Here's the sequence of events for a deletion of node n with
     * predecessor b and successor f, initially:
     *
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+
     *   ...  |   b  |------>|   n  |----->|   f  | ...
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+
     *
     * 1. CAS n's value field from non-null to null.
     *    From this point on, no public operations encountering
     *    the node consider this mapping to exist. However, other
     *    ongoing insertions and deletions might still modify
     *    n's next pointer.
     *
     * 2. CAS n's next pointer to point to a new marker node.
     *    From this point on, no other nodes can be appended to n.
     *    which avoids deletion errors in CAS-based linked lists.
     *
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+       +------+
     *   ...  |   b  |------>|   n  |----->|marker|------>|   f  | ...
     *        +------+       +------+      +------+       +------+
     *
     * 3. CAS b's next pointer over both n and its marker.
     *    From this point on, no new traversals will encounter n,
     *    and it can eventually be GCed.
     *        +------+                                    +------+
     *   ...  |   b  |----------------------------------->|   f  | ...
     *        +------+                                    +------+
     *
     * A failure at step 1 leads to simple retry due to a lost race
     * with another operation. Steps 2-3 can fail because some other
     * thread noticed during a traversal a node with null value and
     * helped out by marking and/or unlinking.  This helping-out
     * ensures that no thread can become stuck waiting for progress of
     * the deleting thread.  The use of marker nodes slightly
     * complicates helping-out code because traversals must track
     * consistent reads of up to four nodes (b, n, marker, f), not
     * just (b, n, f), although the next field of a marker is
     * immutable, and once a next field is CAS'ed to point to a
     * marker, it never again changes, so this requires less care.
     *
     * Skip lists add indexing to this scheme, so that the base-level
     * traversals start close to the locations being found, inserted
     * or deleted -- usually base level traversals only traverse a few
     * nodes. This doesn't change the basic algorithm except for the
     * need to make sure base traversals start at predecessors (here,
     * b) that are not (structurally) deleted, otherwise retrying
     * after processing the deletion.
     *
     * Index levels are maintained as lists with volatile next fields,
     * using CAS to link and unlink.  Races are allowed in index-list
     * operations that can (rarely) fail to link in a new index node
     * or delete one. (We can't do this of course for data nodes.)
     * However, even when this happens, the index lists remain sorted,
     * so correctly serve as indices.  This can impact performance,
     * but since skip lists are probabilistic anyway, the net result
     * is that under contention, the effective "p" value may be lower
     * than its nominal value. And race windows are kept small enough
     * that in practice these failures are rare, even under a lot of
     * contention.
     *
     * The fact that retries (for both base and index lists) are
     * relatively cheap due to indexing allows some minor
     * simplifications of retry logic. Traversal restarts are
     * performed after most "helping-out" CASes. This isn't always
     * strictly necessary, but the implicit backoffs tend to help
     * reduce other downstream failed CAS's enough to outweigh restart
     * cost.  This worsens the worst case, but seems to improve even
     * highly contended cases.
     *
     * Unlike most skip-list implementations, index insertion and
     * deletion here require a separate traversal pass occuring after
     * the base-level action, to add or remove index nodes.  This adds
     * to single-threaded overhead, but improves contended
     * multithreaded performance by narrowing interference windows,
     * and allows deletion to ensure that all index nodes will be made
     * unreachable upon return from a public remove operation, thus
     * avoiding unwanted garbage retention. This is more important
     * here than in some other data structures because we cannot null
     * out node fields referencing user keys since they might still be
     * read by other ongoing traversals.
     *
     * Indexing uses skip list parameters that maintain good search
     * performance while using sparser-than-usual indices: The
     * hardwired parameters k=1, p=0.5 (see method randomLevel) mean
     * that about one-quarter of the nodes have indices. Of those that
     * do, half have one level, a quarter have two, and so on (see
     * Pugh's Skip List Cookbook, sec 3.4).  The expected total space
     * requirement for a map is slightly less than for the current
     * implementation of java.util.TreeMap.
     *
     * Changing the level of the index (i.e, the height of the
     * tree-like structure) also uses CAS. The head index has initial
     * level/height of one. Creation of an index with height greater
     * than the current level adds a level to the head index by
     * CAS'ing on a new top-most head. To maintain good performance
     * after a lot of removals, deletion methods heuristically try to
     * reduce the height if the topmost levels appear to be empty.
     * This may encounter races in which it possible (but rare) to
     * reduce and "lose" a level just as it is about to contain an
     * index (that will then never be encountered). This does no
     * structural harm, and in practice appears to be a better option
     * than allowing unrestrained growth of levels.
     *
     * The code for all this is more verbose than you'd like. Most
     * operations entail locating an element (or position to insert an
     * element). The code to do this can't be nicely factored out
     * because subsequent uses require a snapshot of predecessor
     * and/or successor and/or value fields which can't be returned
     * all at once, at least not without creating yet another object
     * to hold them -- creating such little objects is an especially
     * bad idea for basic internal search operations because it adds
     * to GC overhead.  (This is one of the few times I've wished Java
     * had macros.) Instead, some traversal code is interleaved within
     * insertion and removal operations.  The control logic to handle
     * all the retry conditions is sometimes twisty. Most search is
     * broken into 2 parts. findPredecessor() searches index nodes
     * only, returning a base-level predecessor of the key. findNode()
     * finishes out the base-level search. Even with this factoring,
     * there is a fair amount of near-duplication of code to handle
     * variants.
     *
     * For explanation of algorithms sharing at least a couple of
     * features with this one, see Mikhail Fomitchev's thesis
     * (http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~mikhail/), Keir Fraser's thesis
     * (http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/kaf24/), and Hakan Sundell's
     * thesis (http://www.cs.chalmers.se/~phs/).
     *
     * Given the use of tree-like index nodes, you might wonder why
     * this doesn't use some kind of search tree instead, which would
     * support somewhat faster search operations. The reason is that
     * there are no known efficient lock-free insertion and deletion
     * algorithms for search trees. The immutability of the "down"
     * links of index nodes (as opposed to mutable "left" fields in
     * true trees) makes this tractable using only CAS operations.
