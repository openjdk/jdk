/**
 * A bounded {@linkplain BlockingQueue blocking queue} backed by an
 * array.  This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).  The
 * <em>head</em> of the queue is that element that has been on the
 * queue the longest time.  The <em>tail</em> of the queue is that
 * element that has been on the queue the shortest time. New elements
 * are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
 * operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
 *
 * <p>This is a classic &quot;bounded buffer&quot;, in which a
 * fixed-sized array holds elements inserted by producers and
 * extracted by consumers.  Once created, the capacity cannot be
 * changed.  Attempts to {@code put} an element into a full queue
 * will result in the operation blocking; attempts to {@code take} an
 * element from an empty queue will similarly block.
 *
 * <p>This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering
 * waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering
 * is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set
 * to {@code true} grants threads access in FIFO order. Fairness
 * generally decreases throughput but reduces variability and avoids
 * starvation.
 *
 * <p>This class and its iterator implement all of the
 * <em>optional</em> methods of the {@link Collection} and {@link
 * Iterator} interfaces.
 *
 * <p>This class is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

     * Shared data between iterators and their queue, allowing queue

     *
     * This adds a lot of complexity for the sake of correctly
     * handling some uncommon operations, but the combination of
     * circular-arrays and supporting interior removes (i.e., those
     * not at head) would cause iterators to sometimes lose their
     * places and/or (re)report elements they shouldn't.  To avoid
     * this, when a queue has one or more iterators, it keeps iterator
     * state consistent by:
     *
     * (1) keeping track of the number of "cycles", that is, the
     *     number of times takeIndex has wrapped around to 0.
     * (2) notifying all iterators via the callback removedAt whenever
     *     an interior element is removed (and thus other elements may
     *     be shifted).
     *
     * These suffice to eliminate iterator inconsistencies, but
     * unfortunately add the secondary responsibility of maintaining
     * the list of iterators.  We track all active iterators in a
     * simple linked list (accessed only when the queue's lock is
     * held) of weak references to Itr.  The list is cleaned up using
     * 3 different mechanisms:
     *
     * (1) Whenever a new iterator is created, do some O(1) checking for
     *     stale list elements.
     *
     * (2) Whenever takeIndex wraps around to 0, check for iterators
     *     that have been unused for more than one wrap-around cycle.
     *
     * (3) Whenever the queue becomes empty, all iterators are notified
     *     and this entire data structure is discarded.
     *
     * So in addition to the removedAt callback that is necessary for
     * correctness, iterators have the shutdown and takeIndexWrapped
     * callbacks that help remove stale iterators from the list.
     *
     * Whenever a list element is examined, it is expunged if either
     * the GC has determined that the iterator is discarded, or if the
     * iterator reports that it is "detached" (does not need any
     * further state updates).  Overhead is maximal when takeIndex
     * never advances, iterators are discarded before they are
     * exhausted, and all removals are interior removes, in which case
     * all stale iterators are discovered by the GC.  But even in this
     * case we don't increase the amortized complexity.
     *
     * Care must be taken to keep list sweeping methods from
     * reentrantly invoking another such method, causing subtle
     * corruption bugs.
