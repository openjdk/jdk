     * Wait queue node class.
     *
     * <p>The wait queue is a variant of a "CLH" (Craig, Landin, and
     * Hagersten) lock queue. CLH locks are normally used for
     * spinlocks.  We instead use them for blocking synchronizers, but
     * use the same basic tactic of holding some of the control
     * information about a thread in the predecessor of its node.  A
     * "status" field in each node keeps track of whether a thread
     * should block.  A node is signalled when its predecessor
     * releases.  Each node of the queue otherwise serves as a
     * specific-notification-style monitor holding a single waiting
     * thread. The status field does NOT control whether threads are
     * granted locks etc though.  A thread may try to acquire if it is
     * first in the queue. But being first does not guarantee success;
     * it only gives the right to contend.  So the currently released
     * contender thread may need to rewait.
     *
     * <p>To enqueue into a CLH lock, you atomically splice it in as new
     * tail. To dequeue, you just set the head field.
     * <pre>
     *      +------+  prev +-----+       +-----+
     * head |      | <---- |     | <---- |     |  tail
     *      +------+       +-----+       +-----+
     * </pre>
     *
     * <p>Insertion into a CLH queue requires only a single atomic
     * operation on "tail", so there is a simple atomic point of
     * demarcation from unqueued to queued. Similarly, dequeuing
     * involves only updating the "head". However, it takes a bit
     * more work for nodes to determine who their successors are,
     * in part to deal with possible cancellation due to timeouts
     * and interrupts.
     *
     * <p>The "prev" links (not used in original CLH locks), are mainly
     * needed to handle cancellation. If a node is cancelled, its
     * successor is (normally) relinked to a non-cancelled
     * predecessor. For explanation of similar mechanics in the case
     * of spin locks, see the papers by Scott and Scherer at
     * http://www.cs.rochester.edu/u/scott/synchronization/
     *
     * <p>We also use "next" links to implement blocking mechanics.
     * The thread id for each node is kept in its own node, so a
     * predecessor signals the next node to wake up by traversing
     * next link to determine which thread it is.  Determination of
     * successor must avoid races with newly queued nodes to set
     * the "next" fields of their predecessors.  This is solved
     * when necessary by checking backwards from the atomically
     * updated "tail" when a node's successor appears to be null.
     * (Or, said differently, the next-links are an optimization
     * so that we don't usually need a backward scan.)
     *
     * <p>Cancellation introduces some conservatism to the basic
     * algorithms.  Since we must poll for cancellation of other
     * nodes, we can miss noticing whether a cancelled node is
     * ahead or behind us. This is dealt with by always unparking
     * successors upon cancellation, allowing them to stabilize on
     * a new predecessor, unless we can identify an uncancelled
     * predecessor who will carry this responsibility.
     *
     * <p>CLH queues need a dummy header node to get started. But
     * we don't create them on construction, because it would be wasted
     * effort if there is never contention. Instead, the node
     * is constructed and head and tail pointers are set upon first
     * contention.
     *
     * <p>Threads waiting on Conditions use the same nodes, but
     * use an additional link. Conditions only need to link nodes
     * in simple (non-concurrent) linked queues because they are
     * only accessed when exclusively held.  Upon await, a node is
     * inserted into a condition queue.  Upon signal, the node is
     * transferred to the main queue.  A special value of status
     * field is used to mark which queue a node is on.
     *
     * <p>Thanks go to Dave Dice, Mark Moir, Victor Luchangco, Bill
     * Scherer and Michael Scott, along with members of JSR-166
     * expert group, for helpful ideas, discussions, and critiques
     * on the design of this class.
