package java.util;

/**
 * An ordered collection (also known as a <i>sequence</i>).  The user of this
 * interface has precise control over where in the list each element is
 * inserted.  The user can access elements by their integer index (position in
 * the list), and search for elements in the list.<p>
 *
 * Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements.  More formally,
 * lists typically allow pairs of elements <tt>e1</tt> and <tt>e2</tt>
 * such that <tt>e1.equals(e2)</tt>, and they typically allow multiple
 * null elements if they allow null elements at all.  It is not inconceivable
 * that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by
 * throwing runtime exceptions when the user attempts to insert them, but we
 * expect this usage to be rare.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface places additional stipulations, beyond those
 * specified in the <tt>Collection</tt> interface, on the contracts of the
 * <tt>iterator</tt>, <tt>add</tt>, <tt>remove</tt>, <tt>equals</tt>, and
 * <tt>hashCode</tt> methods.  Declarations for other inherited methods are
 * also included here for convenience.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides four methods for positional (indexed)
 * access to list elements.  Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based.  Note
 * that these operations may execute in time proportional to the index value
 * for some implementations (the <tt>LinkedList</tt> class, for
 * example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically
 * preferable to indexing through it if the caller does not know the
 * implementation.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides a special iterator, called a
 * <tt>ListIterator</tt>, that allows element insertion and replacement, and
 * bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations that the
 * <tt>Iterator</tt> interface provides.  A method is provided to obtain a
 * list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to search for a specified
 * object.  From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with
 * caution.  In many implementations they will perform costly linear
 * searches.<p>
 *
 * The <tt>List</tt> interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and
 * remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list.<p>
 *
 * Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements,
 * extreme caution is advised: the <tt>equals</tt> and <tt>hashCode</tt>
 * methods are no longer well defined on such a list.
 *
 * <p>Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that
 * they may contain.  For example, some implementations prohibit null elements,
 * and some have restrictions on the types of their elements.  Attempting to
 * add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically
 * <tt>NullPointerException</tt> or <tt>ClassCastException</tt>.  Attempting
 * to query the presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception,
 * or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former
 * behavior and some will exhibit the latter.  More generally, attempting an
 * operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in
 * the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an
 * exception or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation.
 * Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>This interface is a member of the
 * <a href="{@docRoot}/../technotes/guides/collections/index.html">
 * Java Collections Framework</a>.

     * Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified

     * <tt>fromIndex</tt> and <tt>toIndex</tt> are equal, the returned list is
     * empty.)  The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural
     * changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa.
     * The returned list supports all of the optional list operations supported
     * by this list.<p>
     *
     * This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of
     * the sort that commonly exist for arrays).  Any operation that expects
     * a list can be used as a range operation by passing a subList view
     * instead of a whole list.  For example, the following idiom
     * removes a range of elements from a list:
     * <pre>
     *      list.subList(from, to).clear();
     * </pre>
     * Similar idioms may be constructed for <tt>indexOf</tt> and
     * <tt>lastIndexOf</tt>, and all of the algorithms in the
     * <tt>Collections</tt> class can be applied to a subList.<p>
     *
     * The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if
     * the backing list (i.e., this list) is <i>structurally modified</i> in
     * any way other than via the returned list.  (Structural modifications are
     * those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such
     * a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.)
     *
     * @param fromIndex low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList
     * @param toIndex high endpoint (exclusive) of the subList
     * @return a view of the specified range within this list
     * @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException for an illegal endpoint index value
