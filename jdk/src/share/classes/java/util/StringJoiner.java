/**
 * {@code StringJoiner} is used to construct a sequence of characters separated
 * by a delimiter and optionally starting with a supplied prefix
 * and ending with a supplied suffix.
 * <p>
 * Prior to adding something to the {@code StringJoiner}, its
 * {@code sj.toString()} method will, by default, return {@code prefix + suffix}.
 * However, if the {@code setEmptyValue} method is called, the {@code emptyValue}
 * supplied will be returned instead. This can be used, for example, when
 * creating a string using set notation to indicate an empty set, i.e.
 * <code>"{}"</code>, where the {@code prefix} is <code>"{"</code>, the
 * {@code suffix} is <code>"}"</code> and nothing has been added to the
 * {@code StringJoiner}.
 *
 * @apiNote
 * <p>The String {@code "[George:Sally:Fred]"} may be constructed as follows:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * StringJoiner sj = new StringJoiner(":", "[", "]");
 * sj.add("George").add("Sally").add("Fred");
 * String desiredString = sj.toString();
 * }</pre>
 * <p>
 * A {@code StringJoiner} may be employed to create formatted output from a
 * {@link java.util.stream.Stream} using
 * {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#toStringJoiner}. For example:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4);
 * String commaSeparatedNumbers = numbers.stream()
 *     .map(i -> i.toString())
 *     .collect(Collectors.toStringJoiner(", ")).toString();
 * }</pre>
 *
 * @see java.util.stream.Collectors#toStringJoiner
