Provides classes for reading and writing the standard ZIP and GZIP
file formats.  Also includes classes for compressing and decompressing
data using the DEFLATE compression algorithm, which is used by the
ZIP and GZIP file formats. Additionally, there are utility classes
for computing the CRC-32 and Adler-32 checksums of arbitrary
input streams.
