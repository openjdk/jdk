/**
 * A state object for collecting statistics such as count, min, max, sum, and
 * average.
 *
 * <p>This class is designed to work with (though does not require)
 * {@linkplain java.util.stream streams}. For example, you can compute
 * summary statistics on a stream of doubles with:
 * <pre> {@code
 * DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = doubleStream.collect(DoubleSummaryStatistics::new,
 *                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::accept,
 *                                                      DoubleSummaryStatistics::combine);
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>{@code DoubleSummaryStatistics} can be used as a
 * {@linkplain java.util.stream.Stream#collect(Collector) reduction}
 * target for a {@linkplain java.util.stream.Stream stream}. For example:
 *
 * <pre> {@code
 * DoubleSummaryStatistics stats = people.stream()
 *     .collect(Collectors.summarizingDouble(Person::getWeight));
 *}</pre>
 *
 * This computes, in a single pass, the count of people, as well as the minimum,
 * maximum, sum, and average of their weights.
 *
 * @implNote This implementation is not thread safe. However, it is safe to use
 * {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#summarizingDouble(java.util.function.ToDoubleFunction)
 * Collectors.toDoubleStatistics()} on a parallel stream, because the parallel
 * implementation of {@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect Stream.collect()}
 * provides the necessary partitioning, isolation, and merging of results for
 * safe and efficient parallel execution.
 * @since 1.8
