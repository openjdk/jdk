/**
 * Hash table based implementation of the <tt>Map</tt> interface, with
 * <em>weak keys</em>.
 * An entry in a <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> will automatically be removed when
 * its key is no longer in ordinary use.  More precisely, the presence of a
 * mapping for a given key will not prevent the key from being discarded by the
 * garbage collector, that is, made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.
 * When a key has been discarded its entry is effectively removed from the map,
 * so this class behaves somewhat differently from other <tt>Map</tt>
 * implementations.
 *
 * <p> Both null values and the null key are supported. This class has
 * performance characteristics similar to those of the <tt>HashMap</tt>
 * class, and has the same efficiency parameters of <em>initial capacity</em>
 * and <em>load factor</em>.
 *
 * <p> Like most collection classes, this class is not synchronized.
 * A synchronized <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> may be constructed using the
 * {@link Collections#synchronizedMap Collections.synchronizedMap}
 * method.
 *
 * <p> This class is intended primarily for use with key objects whose
 * <tt>equals</tt> methods test for object identity using the
 * <tt>==</tt> operator.  Once such a key is discarded it can never be
 * recreated, so it is impossible to do a lookup of that key in a
 * <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> at some later time and be surprised that its entry
 * has been removed.  This class will work perfectly well with key objects
 * whose <tt>equals</tt> methods are not based upon object identity, such
 * as <tt>String</tt> instances.  With such recreatable key objects,
 * however, the automatic removal of <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> entries whose
 * keys have been discarded may prove to be confusing.
 *
 * <p> The behavior of the <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> class depends in part upon
 * the actions of the garbage collector, so several familiar (though not
 * required) <tt>Map</tt> invariants do not hold for this class.  Because
 * the garbage collector may discard keys at any time, a
 * <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> may behave as though an unknown thread is silently
 * removing entries.  In particular, even if you synchronize on a
 * <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> instance and invoke none of its mutator methods, it
 * is possible for the <tt>size</tt> method to return smaller values over
 * time, for the <tt>isEmpty</tt> method to return <tt>false</tt> and
 * then <tt>true</tt>, for the <tt>containsKey</tt> method to return
 * <tt>true</tt> and later <tt>false</tt> for a given key, for the
 * <tt>get</tt> method to return a value for a given key but later return
 * <tt>null</tt>, for the <tt>put</tt> method to return
 * <tt>null</tt> and the <tt>remove</tt> method to return
 * <tt>false</tt> for a key that previously appeared to be in the map, and
 * for successive examinations of the key set, the value collection, and
 * the entry set to yield successively smaller numbers of elements.
 *
 * <p> Each key object in a <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> is stored indirectly as
 * the referent of a weak reference.  Therefore a key will automatically be
 * removed only after the weak references to it, both inside and outside of the
 * map, have been cleared by the garbage collector.
 *
 * <p> <strong>Implementation note:</strong> The value objects in a
 * <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> are held by ordinary strong references.  Thus care
 * should be taken to ensure that value objects do not strongly refer to their
 * own keys, either directly or indirectly, since that will prevent the keys
 * from being discarded.  Note that a value object may refer indirectly to its
 * key via the <tt>WeakHashMap</tt> itself; that is, a value object may
 * strongly refer to some other key object whose associated value object, in
 * turn, strongly refers to the key of the first value object.  One way
 * to deal with this is to wrap values themselves within
 * <tt>WeakReferences</tt> before
 * inserting, as in: <tt>m.put(key, new WeakReference(value))</tt>,
 * and then unwrapping upon each <tt>get</tt>.
 *
 * <p>The iterators returned by the <tt>iterator</tt> method of the collections
 * returned by all of this class's "collection view methods" are
 * <i>fail-fast</i>: if the map is structurally modified at any time after the
 * iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's own
 * <tt>remove</tt> method, the iterator will throw a {@link
 * ConcurrentModificationException}.  Thus, in the face of concurrent
 * modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking
 * arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future.
 *
 * <p>Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed
 * as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the
 * presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators
 * throw <tt>ConcurrentModificationException</tt> on a best-effort basis.
 * Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this
 * exception for its correctness:  <i>the fail-fast behavior of iterators
 * should be used only to detect bugs.</i>
