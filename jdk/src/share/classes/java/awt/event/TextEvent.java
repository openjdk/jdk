/**
 * A semantic event which indicates that an object's text changed.
 * This high-level event is generated by an object (such as a TextComponent)
 * when its text changes. The event is passed to
 * every <code>TextListener</code> object which registered to receive such
 * events using the component's <code>addTextListener</code> method.
 * <P>
 * The object that implements the <code>TextListener</code> interface gets
 * this <code>TextEvent</code> when the event occurs. The listener is
 * spared the details of processing individual mouse movements and key strokes
 * Instead, it can process a "meaningful" (semantic) event like "text changed".
