/**
 * A semantic event which indicates that a component-defined action occurred.
 * This high-level event is generated by a component (such as a
 * <code>Button</code>) when
 * the component-specific action occurs (such as being pressed).
 * The event is passed to every <code>ActionListener</code> object
 * that registered to receive such events using the component's
 * <code>addActionListener</code> method.
 * <p>
 * <b>Note:</b> To invoke an <code>ActionEvent</code> on a
 * <code>Button</code> using the keyboard, use the Space bar.
 * <P>
 * The object that implements the <code>ActionListener</code> interface
 * gets this <code>ActionEvent</code> when the event occurs. The listener
 * is therefore spared the details of processing individual mouse movements
 * and mouse clicks, and can instead process a "meaningful" (semantic)
 * event like "button pressed".
 * <p>
 * An unspecified behavior will be caused if the {@code id} parameter
 * of any particular {@code ActionEvent} instance is not
 * in the range from {@code ACTION_FIRST} to {@code ACTION_LAST}.
 *
 * @see ActionListener
 * @see <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html">Tutorial: How to Write an Action Listener</a>
