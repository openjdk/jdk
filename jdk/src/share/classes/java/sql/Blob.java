/**
 * The representation (mapping) in
 * the Java&trade; programming
 * language of an SQL
 * <code>BLOB</code> value.  An SQL <code>BLOB</code> is a built-in type
 * that stores a Binary Large Object as a column value in a row of
 * a database table. By default drivers implement <code>Blob</code> using
 * an SQL <code>locator(BLOB)</code>, which means that a
 * <code>Blob</code> object contains a logical pointer to the
 * SQL <code>BLOB</code> data rather than the data itself.
 * A <code>Blob</code> object is valid for the duration of the
 * transaction in which is was created.
 *
 * <P>Methods in the interfaces {@link ResultSet},
 * {@link CallableStatement}, and {@link PreparedStatement}, such as
 * <code>getBlob</code> and <code>setBlob</code> allow a programmer to
 * access an SQL <code>BLOB</code> value.
 * The <code>Blob</code> interface provides methods for getting the
 * length of an SQL <code>BLOB</code> (Binary Large Object) value,
 * for materializing a <code>BLOB</code> value on the client, and for
 * determining the position of a pattern of bytes within a
 * <code>BLOB</code> value. In addition, this interface has methods for updating
 * a <code>BLOB</code> value.
 * <p>
 * All methods on the <code>Blob</code> interface must be fully implemented if the
 * JDBC driver supports the data type.
