#  	Default Networking Configuration File

# This file may contain default values for the networking system properties.
# These values are only used when the system properties are not specified
# on the command line or set programatically.
# For now, only the various proxy settings can be configured here.

# Whether or not the DefaultProxySelector will default to System Proxy
# settings when they do exist.
# Set it to 'true' to enable this feature and check for platform
# specific proxy settings
# Note that the system properties that do explicitely set proxies
# (like http.proxyHost) do take precedence over the system settings
# even if java.net.useSystemProxies is set to true.
