\f3jstack\fP prints Java stack traces of Java threads for a given Java process or core file or a remote debug server. For each Java frame, the full class name, method name, 'bci' (byte code index) and line number, if available, are printed. With the \-m option, jstack prints both Java and native frames of all threads along with the 'pc' (program counter). For each native frame, the closest native symbol to 'pc', if available, is printed. C++ mangled names are not demangled. To demangle C++ names, the output of this command may be piped to \f3c++filt\fP. If the given process is running on a 64\-bit VM, you may need to specify the \f2\-J\-d64\fP option, e.g.:
