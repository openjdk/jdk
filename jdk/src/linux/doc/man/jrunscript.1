.LP
.LP
\f3jrunscript\fP is a command line script shell. jrunscript supports both an interactive (read\-eval\-print) mode and a batch (\-f option) mode of script execution. This is a scripting language independent shell. By default, JavaScript is the language used, but the \-l option can be used to specify a different language. Through Java to scripting language communication, jrunscript supports "exploratory programming" style.

If [arguments...] are present and if no \f3\-e\fP or \f3\-f\fP option is used, then the first argument is the script file and the rest of the arguments, if any, are passed as script arguments. If [arguments..] and \f3\-e\fP or \f3\-f\fP option are used, then all [arguments..] are passed as script arguments. If [arguments..], \f3\-e\fP and \f3\-f\fP are missing, interactive mode is used. Script arguments are available to a script in an engine variable named "arguments" of type String array.
