<h1>JVM TI Demonstration Code</h1>

<p>
The 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Virtual Machine Tools Interface (JVM TI)
is a native tool interface provided in JDK 5.0 and newer.
Native libraries that use JVM TI and are loaded into the 
Java Virtual Machine
via the -agentlib, -agentpath, or -Xrun (deprecated) interfaces, are
called Agents.
<p>
<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/latest/docs/guide/jvmti">JVM TI</A>
was designed to work with the
Java Native Interface 
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/latest/docs/guide/jni">JNI</A>),
and eventually displace the 
Java Virtual Machine Debugging Interface 
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jpda/jvmdi-spec.html">JVMDI</A>)
and the 
Java Virtual Machine Profiling Interface 
(<A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/jvmpi/index.html">JVMPI</A>).

<p>
We have created a set of demonstration agents that should
help show many of the features and abilities of the
interface. This list of demonstration agents will change over time.
They are provided as educational tools and as starting
points for Java tool development.

<p>
These agents are built with every JDK build and some basic testing is performed
on a regular basis, but no extensive testbases currently
exist for these agents.
Every JDK installation should include all the pre-built binaries and sources for
all these agents, just look in the demo/jvmti directory of your JDK.


<h2>Using or Running These Agents</h2>

<p>
Using these agents will require the VM to locate the shared library file
before any actual Java code is run.
The JDK installation should contain all the agent libraries in 
the ${JAVA_HOME}/demo/jvmti/<i>agent-name</i>/lib directories.
The Solaris 64bit version would be contained in the sparcv9 or amd64
subdirectory.
If 'java' complains that it can't find the library,
you may need to add the directory containing the library into the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable (Unix), or the PATH environment
variable (Windows).
This is system and platform specific.
If you are using 64bit Solaris (e.g. 'java -d64'), 
you should use LD_LIBRARY_PATH64.
Some agents such as the jdwp (debugger backend)
are located inside the primary JDK directories and will always be found
in those locations.

<p>
The agents that instrument classfiles 
(i.e. BCI, usually through the java_crw_demo library) 
such as heapTracker, mtrace, and minst, 
also need to have the Java classes they use available in the bootclasspath.
The agents will make attempts at automatically adding their jar file
(e.g. heapTracker.jar, mtrace.jar, or minst.jar) to the bootclasspath
with AddToBootstrapClassLoaderSearch from JVM TI at startup
(see the agent_util code).
This is done by locating this jar file at 
${JAVA_HOME}/demo/jvmti/<i>agent-name</i>
where JAVA_HOME is obtained by calling GetSystemProperty from JVM TI
with "java.home".
We recognize that this is not ideal, but felt that as just demonstration
code it was acceptable.
Ideally the agent could find out the actual directory it came from and
locate the jar file relative to that location. 
Our demonstration agents currently do not do this.

<p>
If you choose to modify or change these agents, the above information
is important in making everything is found.
It is recommended that you change the name of the agent when you
modify it to avoid conflicts with the existing demo agents.
Or better yet, go to http://jdk.dev.java.net and submit your
changes to the agent as an RFE to the JDK.


<h2> Demonstration Agents Available </h2>

<ul>

<li>
<A HREF="versionCheck">versionCheck</A>
<br>
This is a extremely small agent that does nothing but check the
version string supplied in the jvmti.h file, with the version
number supplied by the VM at runtime.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="compiledMethodLoad">compiledMethodLoad</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that traces CompiledMethodLoad events along
with the HotSpot specific compile_info parameter.
</li>

<li>
<A HREF="mtrace">mtrace</A>
<br>
This is a small agent that does method tracing.
It uses Bytecode Instrumentation (BCI) via the java_crw_demo library.
</li>

<li>

</li>


</ul>



<h2>Native Library Build Hints</h2>

<p>
All libraries loaded into java are assumed to be MT-safe (Multi-thread safe).
This means that multiple threads could be executing the code at the same
time, and static or global data may need to be placed in critical
sections. See the Raw Monitor interfaces for more information.

<p>
All native libraries loaded into the 
Java Virtual Machine,
including Agent libraries,
need to be compiled and built in a compatible way.
Certain native compilation options or optimizations should be avoided,
and some are required.
More information on this options is available in the man pages for
the various compilers.

<p>
Some native compiler and linker options can create fatal or 
erroneous behavior when native agent libraries are operating
inside the Java Virtual Machine.
It would take too many words to describe all the possible issues with all
the native compiler options, optimizations, and settings.
Here are some recommendations on the basic compiler and linker options
we recommend:

<ul>

<h3> Solaris </h3>

<li>
On Solaris, using the Sun Studio 11 C compiler,
the typical compile and link command lines might look something like:
<br>
For 32bit SPARC:
<br>
<code><ul>
cc -xO2 -mt -xregs=no%appl -xmemalign=4s -xarch=v8 -KPIC -c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
cc -mt -xarch=v8 -z defs -ztext -G -o <i>libXXX.so *.o</i> -lc
</code></ul>
<br>
For 64bit SPARC:
<br>
<code><ul>
cc -xO2 -mt -xregs=no%appl -xarch=v9 -KPIC -c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
cc -mt -xarch=v9 -z defs -ztext -G -o <i>libXXX.so *.o</i> -lc
</code></ul>
<br>
For X86:
<br>
<code><ul>
cc -xO2 -mt -xregs=no%frameptr -KPIC -c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
cc -mt -z defs -ztext -G -o <i>libXXX.so *.o</i> -lc
</code></ul>
<br>
For AMD64:
<br>
<code><ul>
cc -xO2 -mt -xregs=no%frameptr -xarch=amd64 -KPIC -c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
cc -mt -xarch=amd64 -z defs -ztext -G -o <i>libXXX.so *.o</i> -lc
</code></ul>
<br>
</li>

<li>
Architecture/File Format: 
For SPARC 32bit use <code>-xarch=v8</code>, 
for SPARC 64bit use <code>-xarch=v9</code>, 
for X86 (32-bit) 
<i>
leave the option off or use <code>-xarch=generic</code>
</i>,
and for AMD64 (64bit) use <code>-xarch=amd64</code>
with both C and C++.
<br>
This is to be specific as to the architecture and the file format
of the .o files (and ultimately of the .so). 
</li>

<li>
MT-Safe, Position Independent: Use <code>-KPIC -mt</code> 
with both C and C++.
</li>

<li>
Register usage: For SPARC (both 32bit and 64bit) use 
<code>-xregs=no%appl</code> and for X86 and AMD64 use <code>-xregs=no%frameptr</code>
with both C and C++.
</li>

<li>
Alignment: For SPARC 32bit use -xmemalign=4s and for SPARC 64bit do NOT use <code>-xmemalign=4</code>
with both C and C++.
</li>

<li>
Dependencies: Use <code>ldd -r <i>LibraryName</i></code>.
<br>
After the shared library has been built, the utility
<code>ldd</code> can be used to verify that all dependent libraries 
have been satisfied, and all externs can be found.
If <code>ldd</code> says anything is missing, it is very likely that the JVM will also
be unable to load this library.
This usually means that you missed some <code>-l<i>name</i></code>
options when building the library, or perhaps forgot a <code>-R path</code>
option that tells the library where to look for libraries at runtime.
</li>

<h3> Linux </h3>

<li>
On Linux, using the gcc version 3.2, 
the typical compile and link command lines might look something like:
<br>
For X86:
<br>
<code><ul>
gcc -O2 -fPIC -pthread -DLINUX -c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
gcc -z defs -static-libgcc -shared -o <i>libXXX.so *.o</i> -lc
</code></ul>
<br>
For AMD64:
<br>
<code><ul>
gcc -O2 -fPIC -pthread -DLINUX -D_LP64=1 -c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
gcc -z defs -static-libgcc -shared -o <i>libXXX.so *.o</i> -lc
</code></ul>
<br>
</li>

<li>
MT-Safe, Position Independent: 
Use <code>-fPIC -pthread</code>.
</li>

<li>
Agent Demo Code: Needs -DLINUX
</li>

<li>
Register Usage: Use <code>-fno-omit-frame-pointer</code>.
<br>
It is important that these libraries have frame pointer register usage, see the above comments on the Solaris 
<code>-xregs=no%frameptr</code>
option.
</li>

<li>
Library: Use -static-libgcc.
<br>
When building the shared library (-shared option), this option
allows for maximum portability of the library between different
flavors of Linux.
The problem we have seen with Linux is that we cannot depend
on a compatible shared gcc library existing on all the versions of
Linux we can run on.
By doing this static link, the version script becomes more
important, making sure you don't expose any extern symbols
you didn't intend to.
</li>

<li>
Dependencies: Use <code>ldd -r <i>LibraryName</i></code>.
<br>
Provides the same checking as Solaris (see above).
</li>

<h3> Windows </h3>

<li>
On Windows and using the Microsoft C++ Compiler Visual Studio .NET 2003,
the typical compile and link command lines might look something like:
<br>
For X86:
<br>
<code><ul>
cl /O1 /MD /D _STATIC_CPPLIB /c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
link /dll /opt:REF /out:<i>XXX.dll *.obj</i>
</code></ul>
<br>
For AMD64:
<br>
<code><ul>
cl /O1 /MD /D _STATIC_CPPLIB /c <i>*.c</i>
<br>
link /dll /opt:REF /out:<i>XXX.dll *.obj</i>
</code></ul>
<br>
</li>

<li>
Library: Use <code>/opt:REF </code> when building the dll.
</li>

<li>
MS DLL Runtime: Use the <code>/MD /D _STATIC_CPPLIB</code> option.
<br>
This causes your dll to become dependent on just MSVCR*.DLL.
The option /D _STATIC_CPPLIB prevents you from becoming dependent on the
C++ library MSVCP*.DLL.
This is what we use in the JDK, but there are probably many combinations
that you could safely use, unfortunately there are many combinations
of runtimes that will not work. 
Check the Microsoft site on proper use of runtimes.
</li>

<li>
Dependencies: Use VC++ <code>dumpbin /exports</code> and the VC++ "Dependency Walker".
<br>
Provides dependency information similar to <code>ldd</code>.
</li>

</ul>
