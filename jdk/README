README:
  This file should be located at the top of the jdk Mercurial repository.

  See http://openjdk.java.net/ for more information about the OpenJDK.

Simple Build Instructions:

  1. Download and install a JDK 6 from
     http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp
     Set the environment variable ALT_BOOTDIR to the location of this JDK 6.

  2. Either download and install the latest JDK7 from
     http://download.java.net/openjdk/jdk7/, or build your own complete
     OpenJDK7 by using the top level Makefile in the OpenJDK Mercurial forest.
     Set the environment variable ALT_JDK_IMPORT_PATH to the location of
     this latest JDK7 or OpenJDK7 build.
     
  3. Check the sanity of doing a build with the current machine:
       cd make && gnumake sanity
     See README-builds.html if you run into problems.
  
  4. Do a partial build of the jdk:
       cd make && gnumake all
  
  5. Construct the images:
       cd make && gnumake images
     The resulting JDK image should be found in build/*/j2sdk-image
