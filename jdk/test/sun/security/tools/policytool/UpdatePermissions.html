First, policytool will be invoked.<br><br>

0) Find (or create) a temporary directory that you have write access to.

and click "OK".<br>
(Or use the temporary directory mentioned in Step 0 if it's not '/tmp'.
For example, "C:\foo\tmp\ptool.test" on Windows)<br><br>

9) Check the content of the file created in the previous step<br><br>

10) check to make sure that the new entry is in the policy file.<br><br>
