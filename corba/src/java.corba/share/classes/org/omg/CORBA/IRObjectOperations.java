 * Interface Repository. Some of these operations are defined in
 * the IRObject. All IR objects inherit from the IRObject interface,

 * generic interface from which all other Interface Repository interfaces
 * are derived, even the Repository itself.) All java implementations of
 * IR objects must implement the IRObjectOperations interface.
